Students’ initial computer experience and attitude toward collaboration influenced their partners. Those with more experience relative to their partner achieved greater computer confidence and more positive attitudes toward computing.

Our proof-of-concept prototype of the Idea Garden concept in the CoScripter end-user programming environment currently targets three barriers reported in end-user programming literature.

The experiment consisted of participants using the Scratch Program and Creative Computing Guidebook, both developed by the MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) media laboratory, for a total of 15 hours. An experimental group and a control group were formed and consisted of fourth to sixth graders. DBL was applied to the experimental group, while a traditional, direct method of teaching was applied to the control group. The experiment was designed to examine several aspects of learning: self-efficacy, self-interest, and self-CT. Moreover, we compared changes in students’ perceptions of computers and analysed differences in students’ responses between the two groups according to each of the steps of DBL. Then, we verified the effects of DBL by examining the progress of each group and the differences between the two groups. At the end},

  abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), computational thinking (CT), and mathematics education (ME) for young students (K-8). Specifically, it focuses on three key elements that are common to AI, CT and ME: agency, modeling of phenomena and abstracting concepts beyond specific instances. Design/methodology/approach - The theoretical framework of this paper adopts a sociocultural perspective where knowledge is constructed in interactions with others (Vygotsky, 1978). Others also refers to themultiplicity of technologies that surround us, including both the digital artefacts of our new media world, and the human methods and specialized processes acting in the world. Technology is not simply a tool for human intention. It is an actor in the cognitive ecology of immersive humans-with-technology environments (Levy, 1993, 1998) that supports but also disrupts and reorganizes human thinking (Borba and Villarreal, 2005).

However, there is still no consensus on a CT definition or how to measure it. In response, we attempt to address both issues from a psychometric approach.

On the second hand, the criterion validity of the CTt is studied with respect to other standardized psychological tests: the Primary Mental Abilities (PMA) battery, and the RP30 problem-solving test. Thus, it is intended to provide a new instrument for CT measurement and additionally give evidence of the nature of CT through its associations with key related psychological constructs. Results sh},

Few K-12 programming environments are designed to teach debugging, and most debugging research were conducted on college-aged students. In this paper, we presented debugging exercises to 6th–8th grade students and analyzed their problem solving behaviors in a programming game – BOTS. Apart from the perspective of prior literature, we identified student behaviors in relation to problem solving stages, and correlated these behaviors with student prior programming experience and performance. We found that in our programming game, debugging required deeper understanding than writing new codes. We also found that problem solving behaviors were significantly correlated with students’ self-explanation quality, number of code edits, and prior programming experience.

Here, we test the effects of units with different programming content within a virtual robotics context on both learning gains and motivational changes in middle school (6th–8th grade) robotics classrooms. Significant learning gains were found overall, particularly for groups introduced to content involving program flow, the structural logic of program execution. Relative gains for these groups were particularly high on items that require the transfer of knowledge to dissimilar contexts. Reaching units that included program flow content was also associated with greater maintenance of programming interest when compared with other units. Therefore, our results suggest that explicit instruction in the structural logic of programming may develop deeper transferrable programming knowledge and prevent declines in some motivational factor},

To better improve university students' CT competence, collaborative programming is regarded as an effective learning approach. However, how novice programmers develop CT competence through collaborative problem solving remains unclear. This study adopted an innovative approach, quantitative ethnography, to analyze the collaborative programming activities of a high‐performing and a low‐performing team. Both the discourse analysis and epistemic network models revealed that across concepts, practices, and identity, the high‐performing team exhibited CT that was systematic, whereas the CT of the low‐performing team was characterized by tinkering or guess‐and‐check approaches. However, the low‐performing group's CT development trajectory ultimately converged towards the high‐performing group's. This study thus improves unders},

In this approach, students build their knowledge while constructing the difference equation that describes a physical (or engineering) phenomenon, based on specific cases investigated in the spreadsheet.

In applying survival analysis to a sample of more than 20,000 participants from one popular computer science MOOC, we found that students' precomputational thinking skills and their perseverance in assignment submission strongly predict their persistence in the MOOC. Moreover, we discovered that precomputational thinking skills, programming experience, and gender, which were previously considered to be constant predictors of students' retention, have effects that attenuate over the course milestones. This finding suggests that MOOC educators should take a growth perspective towards students' persistence: As students overcome},

However, there is little effort to develop adaptive educational computer games for promoting students' computational thinking (CT). In this study, an adaptive computer game is introduced, called AutoThinking, that not only promotes both CT skills and conceptual knowledge, but also provides adaptivity in both game-play and learning processes. To evaluate the possible effects of the game, an experimental study was carried out with 79 students in an elementary school in Estonia. AutoThinking and a conventional technology-enhanced learning approach were used for teaching CT to the experimental and control group, respectively. Our results reveal that AutoThinking improved students' CT skills and conceptual knowledge better than the conventional approach.

While CT has a growing presence within K-12 classrooms, libraries play an essential role in introducing these critical skills to all. Objective: Assessing learning in libraries is difficult given their informal nature. This is especially true when trying to assess a new and ill-defined construct like CT. A first step towards better supporting informal educators is to identify the motivations for bringing CT into informal spaces and to understand the current state of assessing CT in public libraries. Method: Thirty-seven interviews with library staff from across the United States were conducted and analyzed. Findings: This work reveals the variety of motivations justifying the inclusion of CT programming for youth in libraries, the challenges associated with assessing CT in libraries, and identifies the assessments library staff would like to },

However, there is not consensus on a guiding framework, definition, or set of proxies in which to measure CT. We are addressing this problem by using Evidence Centered Design (ECD) to develop an assessment of kindergarten-aged children's CT. Objective: To present a design case on the development of the assessment, specifically the algorithmic thinking (AT) tasks and to share validity evidence that emerged. Method: We focus on the AT sub-component of CT and present the principled assessment design process using ECD. Findings: Our operationalization of CT includes spatial reasoning as a sub-component. Pilot results showed an acceptable internal consistency reliability for the AT items and critical design decisions that contributed to validity evidence. Implications: An important contribution of this work is the inclusion of spatial reasoning in our definition of early childhood CT.},

Relatively few studies have examined programming for CT in informal online communities, especially for large scale quantitative research. With the repurposing and appropriation of code becoming standard practice for youth programmers in new and networked communities, this study proposes a model to investigate and explain how such remixing practices influence CT in learners. In particular, we use social cognitive theory to transform log data from more than 100,000 students and 200,000 programs in the Scratch online community into cognitive, environmental and behavioral factors. Then path modeling was used to show how the community environment can affect learners' remixing and further impact CT skills.

However, there is little understanding of whether children are developmentally ready to think computationally and what specific CT concepts and skills can be developed at various ages. This study explored the developmental and gender differences in CT skills of 197 Grade 4–6 students (aged 9–13) before being exposed to instruction and investigated the age–gender interaction effects on their CT acquisition in an intervention combining both programming and non‐programming (unplugged) activities. Results show that students' CT skills followed a developmental progression before instruction. Gender difference across ages was insignificant in conditionals, logical operators, pattern recognition and generalization skills. Additionally, students of different ages developed CT differently during the intervention, and their CT acquisition was unaffected by gender. Implication},

Therefore, research on CT assessment has lately progressed towards developing and validating reliable CT assessment tools, which are crucial for evaluating students' potential learning progress and thus the effectiveness of suggested curricular programs. Several CT assessment tools were developed for elementary, high-school, and university students over the last years. Moreover, associations between CT scores and other cognitive abilities were unraveled. However, studies on the topic in primary school level are scarce. Like the general concept of intelligence, CT remains broadly defined as the ability to combine algorithmic operations to form complex solutions in order to solve problems effectively, utilizing concepts of computer science with or without the use of computers. In this study, we aimed at specifying a cognitive definition of CT, focusing on the under-investigated pop},

Results showed three types of lesson plans, including lessons to use basic ePCR functionality to teach students lower-level CT skills, lessons to teach students basic to intermediate coding skills, and lessons to use the technology at the advanced level. Next, we applied the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework and conducted a second two-step cluster analysis to identify how the technology (ePCR technology), content},

  abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) is regarded as a crucial competency for all children in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. There are misconceptions about CT which confounds CT skills with programming skills. However, CT skills and programming skills are not the same. CT is a broader skillset of cognitive thinking that is integral to complex problem solving. Teaching and assessing CT should not only focus on computer programming. In this project, a new design-based learning (DBL) approach was proposed to improve elementary school students' CT. This approach not only included programming skills, but also integrated CT practices with authentic real-life contexts. Corresponding to recent conceptions of CT, we also assessed CT in a more comprehensive manner. A quasi-experiment study was carried out to assess how the intervention was associated with students' self-perceived CT skills using both quantitative and qualitative methods. In the treatment group, twenty-three fourth graders engaged in three },

Although game-based learning (GBL) has been shown to improve student's CT skills, students may fail to self-evaluate or debate as they play games, thus failing to develop higher-order thinking. Also not widely explored is how teachers are to practice the CT core competencies during the learning process to cultivate students' problem-solving thinking. As the adoption of student-generated questions (SGQ) is an instructional strategy to promote higher-order thinking, we develop a GBL platform that uses this strategy to enhance students' CT skills, learning motivation, and learning confidence. For this purpose, fifty-three primary school students were recruited for this study, and data were collected during four classes of experimental CT activities.

Objectives: To fill the gap in knowledge, we aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a web‐based parent education program on improving children's CT skills. Additionally, we sought to determine if children's age, gender and family socioeconomic status had any impact on the development of CT skills. Methods: We selected 86 adult–child pairs in the K3 age group to participate in a 4‐week intervention program using a quasi‐experimental approach. Results: After 4 weeks, children in the intervention group had improved their CT skills more than their peers in the control group.

The opacity of these applications, however, means that it is not clear how much they truly serve their users. A promising way to address the issue of possible undesired biases consists in giving users control by letting them configure a system and aligning its performance with users' own preferences. However, as the present paper argues, this form of control over an algorithmic system demands an algorithmic literacy that also entails a certain way of making oneself knowable: users must interrogate their own dispositions and see how these can be formalized such that they can be translated into the algorithmic system. This may, however, extend already existing practices through which people are monitored and probed and means that exerting such control requires users to direct a computational mode of thinking at themselves.},

CT may be used to support language education. Courses in English as a foreign language often need an effective writing component that includes writing organization and language use, as demonstrated by the poor writing samples often generated by students of these courses. To address the problems, CT, which is a higher-order mode of problem-solving and knowledge acquisition optimization, was used. The experimental group was instructed using the CT teaching model based on CT's essential components (decomposition, generalization, abstraction, algorithm, and evaluation), whereas the control group was taught using the conventional method. In total, 58 undergraduate students divided into two groups participated in this study. A combination of writing, CT skills, surveys, and interviews were used to collect data according to },

THF is employed in determining hikers' positions in the course of solving an optimization problem. HOA's performance is demonstrated by benchmarking with 29 well-known test functions (including unimodal, multimodal, fixed-dimension multimodal, and composite functions), three engineering design problems (EDPs), (including I-beam, tension/compression spring, and gear train problems) and two N-P Hard problems (i.e. Traveling Salesman's and Knapsack Problems).

However, research gaps remain in understanding how SRL and CT interact from a developmental perspective. Our study designed a program with tailored animations and worksheets to specifically foster students' learning and cognitive development. Using a mixed-methods approach, we administered surveys among 1235 students from 29 Hong Kong primary schools to investigate a dynamic learning system comprising SRL and CT in a large-scale CT program. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 students to further probe insights. Quantitative findings revealed a mutually reinforcing relationship in the dynamic system, suggesting that higher SRL skills enhance cognitive CT abilities, and vice versa. Complementing these results, qualitative findings showed that integrating animations and worksheets into the CT prog},

Prior research indicates that Augmented Reality (AR) games appeal to children with ASD for learning social skills but lack a structured framework and clear instructions for grasping social concepts. Therefore, this research aims to develop AR game content with a social story context and computational thinking specifically tailored for specific social situations. The goal is to assist children with ASD in mastering the developmental context and social structure of complex social situations through sequential and staged game activities. This helps children with ASD develop social skills and reciprocal behaviors. Four high-functioning children with ASD, aged 6 -9, participated in the experiment. Their behavioral performance during game interactions, learning, and social task accomplishments was observed using a multiple-baseline design across subjects. After thr},

  abstract = {The potential role of spin in biological systems is a primary topic in quantum biology. However, much of this research focuses on electron spin. A recent hypothesis suggests that nuclear spin may be better suited to biological processes, being less sensitive to decoherence. The hypothesis details how phosphorus nuclei might be prepared in a spin entangled state, how this entanglement is protected by assembly into calcium phosphate (Posner) molecules, and how this entanglement might modulate calcium ion production and concomitant neural activation. In this paper we investigate the robustness of quantum effects such as coherence and entanglement in Posner molecules. We investigate how these effects are directly dependent on specific parameters such as spin-spin coupling strengths and Posner molecule symmetry. We also investigate how lithium isotope doped Posner molecules differentially modulate quantum resources such as coherence and entanglement and whether this is a viable explanation},

Latent profile analysis, which examines the interplay between variables to distinguish subgroups of individuals, has recently emerged in studies of computational thinking (CT) as a method for identifying student profiles. However, the latent profiles of CT teachers have not yet been analysed. We therefore analysed the latent profiles of a sample of 493 teachers who had participated in a teacher development programme in CT, according to their knowledge and perceived usefulness of CT. Three profiles were identified: (1) highly knowledgeable with high perceived usefulness, (2) knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness, and (3) less knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness. Qualitative data further triangulated these findings. We also examined the learning achievement of 12,105 students taught by},

Since its inception many of the algorithms proposed for solving geometric problems, published in the literature, have been found to be incorrect. These incorrect algorithms rather than being 'purely mathematical' often contain a strong kinesthetic component. This paper explores the relationship between computational geometric thinking and kinesthetic thinking, the effect of the latter on the correctness and efficiency of the resulting algorithms, and their implications for education.},

Metonymy is a rhetorical device where the speaker states a referent that is structurally related to the intended referent.

ABSTRACT
At institutions with an emphasis on authentic research experiences as an integral part of the biology curriculum, COVID created a huge challenge for course instructors whose learning objectives were designed for such experiences. Moving such laboratory experiences online when remote learning became necessary has resulted in a new model for CUREs that utilizes free online databases to provide not only a novel research experience for students, but also the opportunity to engage in big data analysis. Cancer BioPortal (cBioPortal) is an open-access collective cancer research resource for storing and exploring clinical, genomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data. cBioPortal eliminates the computational barrier of interpreting complex genomic data by providing easily understandable visualization that can be interpreted and translated into relevant biological insights. Because no prior computational knowledge is required, cBioPortal is an ideal educational tool for either in-person or distance learning environments. We developed a pedagogical approach, video tutorials, and data analysis workflows centered on using cBioPortal. Pedagogically, students develop an initial research outline that is continually updated and graded throughout the project. Progress during the project or course is assessed by a series of student presentations that are 5 to 15 min in length and are aimed at explaining the approach used in data acquisition, interpretation of the data, and relevance to the initial hypothesis. While cancer-specific, this analysis platform appeals to a wide range of classes and student interests. Further, the project has been successfully done both as an independent research experience and as part of a virtual class-based research project.},

This paper sets out the work of the Tools for Exploratory Learning Programme within the ESRC Initiative Information Technology in Education. The research examines young secondary children's reasoning with computational tools. We distinguish between exploratory and expressive modes of learning, that is, interaction with another's model and creation of one's own model, respectively. The research focuses on reasoning, rather than learning, along three dimensions: quantitative, qualitative, and semi-quantitative. It provides a 3 × 2 classification of tasks according to modes of learning and types of reasoning. Modelling tools were developed for the study and descriptions of these are given. The research examined children's reasoning with tools in all three dimensions looking more exhaustively at the semi-quantitative. Pupils worked either in an exploratory mode or an expressive mode on one of the following topics: Traffic, Health and Diet, and Shops and Profits. They spent 3-4 h individually with a researcher over 2 weeks, carrying out four different activities: reasoning without the computer; learning to manipulate first the computer then later the tool and finally carrying out a task with the modelling tool. Pupils were between 12 and 14 yr. Research questions both about children's reasoning when working with or creating models and about the nature of the tools used are discussed. Finally an analytic scheme is set out which describes the nature of the causal and non-causal reasoning observed together with some tentative results.},

The standard language for studying strategic choice in economics is game theory. Game theory provides concrete mathematical formulas for linking strategic actions to rewarding payoffs. After outlining the four components necessary to make predictions about strategic social behavior, we present recent evidence that the computations predicted by game theory in specific strategic choice contexts are reflected in the brain. In addition, we discuss links between strategic decision making and the psychological concept of theory of mind. We conclude by suggesting that developing mathematical models of social and strategic actions may aid in the understanding of how the brain implements typical choice behavior as well as categorizing dysfunctions that lead to aberrant behavior in psychiatric disorders.},

  abstract = {Despite the recent success of neural network models in mimicking animal performance on various tasks, critics worry that these models fail to illuminate brain function. We take it that a central approach to explanation in systems neuroscience is that of mechanistic modeling, where understanding the system requires us to characterize its parts, organization, and activities, and how those give rise to behaviors of interest. However, it remains controversial what it takes for a model to be mechanistic, and whether computational models such as neural networks qualify as explanatory on this approach. We argue that certain kinds of neural network models are actually good examples of mechanistic models, when an appropriate notion of mechanistic mapping is deployed. Building on existing work on model-to-mechanism mapping (3M), we describe criteria delineating such a notion, which we call 3M++. These criteria require us, first, to identify an abstract level of description that is still detailed enough to be “runnable”, and then, to construct model-to-brain mappings using the same principles as those employed for brain-to-brain mapping across individuals. Perhaps surprisingly, the abstractions required are just those already in use in experimental neuroscience and deployed in the construction of more familiar computational models — just as the principles of inter-brain mappings are very much in the spirit of those already employed in the collection and analysis of data across animals. In a companion paper, we address the relationship between optimization and intelligibility, in the context of functional evolutionary explanations. Taken together, mechanistic interpretations of computational models and the dependencies between form and function illuminated by optimization processes can help us to understand why brain systems are built they way they are.},

Geographic information systems (GIS) and science are a big part of computational human geography but the notion is considerably broader, encompassing spatial process modeling and simulation, the modeling of spatial decision and behavior, visualization techniques, most aspects of spatial analysis, and an increasing number of other areas. Computation in human geography goes back to the beginnings of the quantitative revolution and is philosophically related though methodologically distinct from it. Two major thrusts have persisted through the years: the use of numerical techniques to solve large, complex quantitative problems; and the development of models of complex spatial processes expressed directly in computational terms. Typical exponents of the latter kinds of applications are cellular automata models of urban and environmental processes, and agent-based models of spatial decision and behavior. More recent developments involve applications of mobile and portable computing. Critiques of computational human geography originate from both within the field and from the humanistic and social theory perspectives. The former address a number of epistemological and methodological problems while the latter tend to focus on issues of ontology and representation.},

  abstract = {While games of chance have been played for thousands of years, and while experienced players often had good intuitive ideas of the relative frequencies of various outcomes, the concept of probability as referring to the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes of a ‘fair’ gambling device emerged only 500 or so years ago in Western societies. That allowed evaluation of new games not yet played and later led to a more abstract conception of probability as a measure satisfying certain conditions (‘axioms’). Only in the past 150 years or so has probability had a major role in science and only in the last 50 years or so in everyday life—as for example in evaluating medical outcomes or technological risks or manufacturer liability. Thus, especially in attempting to assess probability in everyday situations, our intuitions are often deficient—more so than those concerning quantity, space, and time. The major problem is not, however, one of making random errors in probability judgments but of making systematic ones that result from a number of well-known and research systematic cognitive biases and heuristics, which are described in this article. These systematic departures from rational assessment do not imply that coherent and accurate probabilistic thinking is (anywhere near) impossible, but that when departures from coherence and accuracy occur, they tend to follow a predictable pattern.},

Confirmation holism, by contrast, is the thesis that only a whole system of thoughts or a whole theory can be confirmed by experience. Social atomism in modern philosophy goes back to Hobbes. Social holism comes up in romanticism and its predecessors; it is worked out by Hegel. In today's discussion, the rule-following considerations that are developed by Kripke on behalf of the later Wittgenstein are the main argument for social holism. Social atomists counter this argument by a naturalistic account of rule following in terms of certain dispositions to behavior.},

  abstract = {This book is intended to be an introduction to various applications of computational toxicology and to show how these approaches are currently being used effectively for risk assessment purposes in the near term. It is important to note that the field of computational toxicology is rapidly evolving and that subsequent editions of this book will take up new methods that are currently under development, such as high-throughput screening, and others that are still in a conceptual stage. There are many advantages for including computational toxicology approaches in the risk assessment process. Among these are reducing costs, minimizing use of animals in toxicology testing, improving speed in providing answers regarding chemicals in emergency situations such as the Gulf Oil spill, and dealing with the common problem of decision making for chemical mixtures. In addition, computational methods may be used for extrapolating or translating data from both in vitro and in vivo experimental animal test systems for human risk assessments of chemicals and drugs. In addition, computational methods may be used for focusing laboratory studies into productive areas by data mining the published literature and developing testable hypotheses by application of systems biology approaches to identify chemical interactions with functional molecular pathways to generate a more comprehensive picture of likely primary and secondary modes of chemical or drug activity. In summary, there is much that computational toxicology is now contributing to helping make better societal risk assessment decisions about chemicals and drugs. The future for these approaches is optimistic and limited only by human ingenuity and availability of resources.},

  abstract = {The merging of the computational theory of mind and evolutionary thinking leads to a kind of rationalism, in which enduring truths about the world have become implicit in the computations that enable the brain to cope with the experienced world. The dead reckoning computation, for example, is implemented within the brains of animals as one of the mechanisms that enables them to learn where they are (Gallistel, 1990, Gallistel, 1995). It integrates a velocity signal with respect to a time signal. Thus, the manner in which position and velocity relate to one another in the world is reflected in the manner in which signals representing those variables are processed in the brain. I use principles of information theory and Bayesian inference to derive from other simple principles explanations for: (1) the failure of partial reinforcement to increase reinforcements to acquisition; (2) the partial reinforcement extinction effect; (3) spontaneous recovery; (4) renewal; (5) reinstatement; (6) resurgence (aka facilitated reacquisition). Like the principle underlying dead-reckoning, these principles are grounded in analytic considerations. They are the kind of enduring truths about the world that are likely to have shaped the brain's computations.},

We then describe a recently proposed practical framework, which quantifies natural language learnability, allowing specific learnability predictions to be made for the first time. In previous work, this framework was used to make learnability predictions for a wide variety of linguistic constructions, for which learnability has been much debated. Here, we present a new experiment which tests these learnability predictions.

Results of neu-rosimulations indicate the incremental influence of DA and NA over computational resources of a psycho-emotional state while 5-HT decreases the computational resources used to calculate a psycho-emotional state. This way we indicate the feasibility of the bio-plausible re-implementation of psycho-emotional states in a computational system.

In recent years, the availability of free and user-friendly programming languages has fuelled the interest of researchers and educators to explore how computational thinking can be introduced in K-12 contexts.

From the review, we propose that more K-12 intervention studies centering on computational practices and computational perspectives could be conducted in the regular classroom. To better examine these two dimensions, students could be asked to verbalize their thought process using think aloud protocol while programming and their on-screen programming activity could be captured and analyzed. Predetermined categories based on both past and recent programming studies could be used to guide the analysis of the qualitative data. As for the instructional implication, it is proposed that a constructionism-based problem-solving learning environment, with information processing, scaffolding and reflection activities, could be designed to foster computational practices and computational perspectives.},

L’intelligence artificielle (IA) recouvre les technologies qui reproduisent, par la machine, quatre dimensions de l’intelligence humaine, à savoir la perception, l’analyse, l’action et l’apprentissage. Les progrès technologiques, combinés dans ces domaines, permettent de générer et d’analyser des données massives pour modéliser la réalité d’un phénomène. Ces modèles sont ensuite réactualisés par l’accumulation de nouvelles données afin d’aider à la prise de décision et prédire le futur. Appliquée à la problématique du développement d’un médicament, l’IA permet d’établir des modèles de maladies à partir de données de profilage moléculaire de patients. Par sa puissance de calcul, l’IA intègre ces données multimodales massives dans un modèle permettant : (i) de rendre compte de l’hétérogénéité des maladies ; et (ii) d’identifier des cibles thérapeutiques importantes dans la physiopathologie. D’autres analyses computationnelles sont utilisées pour identifier des molécules thérapeutiques interagissant avec ces cibles, optimiser ces molécules ou repositionner des molécules anciennes dans de nouvelles indications. La modélisation par l’IA aide également à identifier des biomarqueurs d’efficacité, définir des combinaisons de molécules thérapeutiques pertinentes, concevoir des études cliniques innovantes avec des groupes placebo virtuels… Cette convergence révolutionnaire entre les biotechnologies, les sciences du médicament et l’IA donne aujourd’hui naissance à une médecine computationnelle de précision applicable à toutes les maladies chroniques, qui offrira des traitements parfaitement ciblés prenant en compte les spécificités du patient quant à sa physiologie, sa maladie, sa relation à l’environnement.
Summary
Artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses technologies recapitulating four dimensions of human intelligence, i.e. sensing, thinking, acting and learning. The convergence of technological advances in those fields allows to integrate massive data and build probabilistic models of a problem. The latter can be continuously updated by incorporating new data to inform decision-making and predict the future. In support of drug discovery and development, AI allows to generate disease models using data obtained following extensive molecular profiling of patients. Given its superior computational power, AI can integrate those big multimodal data to generate models allowing: (i) to represent patient heterogeneity; and (ii) identify therapeutic targets with inferences of causality in the pathophysiology. Additional computational analyses can help identifying and optimizing drugs interacting with these targets, or even repurposing existing molecules for a new indication. AI-based modeling further supports the identification of biomarkers of efficacy, the selection of appropriate combination therapies and the design of innovative clinical studies with virtual placebo groups. The convergence of biotechnologies, drug sciences and AI is fostering the emergence of a computational precision medicine predicted to yield therapies or preventive measures precisely tailored to patient characteristics in terms of their physiology, disease features and environmental risk exposure.},

  abstract = {When thinking about possibility, one can consider both epistemic and deontic principles (i.e., physical possibility and permissibility). Cultural influences may lead individuals to weigh epistemic and deontic obligations differently; developing possibility conceptions are therefore positioned to be affected by cultural surroundings. Across two studies, 251 U.S. and Chinese 4-, 6-, and 8-year-olds sampled from major metropolitan areas in Texas and the Hubei, Sichuan, Gansu, and Guangdong Provinces judged the possibility of impossible, improbable, and ordinary events. Across cultures and ages, children judged ordinary events as possible and impossible events as impossible; cultural differences emerged in developing conceptions of improbable events. Whereas U.S. children became more likely to judge these events possible with age, Chinese children's judgments remained consistent with age: Chinese 4- to 8-year-olds judged these events to be possible ∼25% of the time. In Study 2, to test whether this difference was attributable to differential prioritization of epistemic versus deontic constraints, children also judged whether each event was an epistemic violation (i.e., required magic to happen) and a deontic violation (i.e., would result in someone getting in trouble). With age, epistemic judgments were increasingly predictive of possibility judgments for improbable events for U.S. children, and decreasingly so for Chinese children. Contrary to our predictions, deontic judgments were not predictive. We propose that cultural valuation of norms might shape children's developing intuitions about possibility. We discuss our findings in light of three accounts of possibility conceptions, suggesting ways to integrate cultural context into each.},

Mathematical and computational techniques can provide complementary insight into this inherently complex and nonlinear system. They allow us to characterise and predict the behaviour of the retina, as well as to test hypotheses which are experimentally intractable. In this review, we survey some of the key theoretical models of the retina in the healthy, developmental and diseased states. The main insights derived from each of these modelling studies are highlighted, as are model predictions which have yet to be tested, and data which need to be gathered to inform future modelling work. Possible directions for future research are also discussed. Whilst the present modelling studies have achieved great success in unravelling the workings of the retina, they have yet to achieve their full potential. For this to happen, greater involvement with the modelling community is required, and stronger collaborations forged between experimentalists, clinicians and theoreticians. It is hoped that, in addition to bringing the fruits of current modelling studies to the attention of the ophthalmological community, this review will encourage many such future collaborations.},

This chapter discusses various aspects of biological perspectives on creativity. Some of the research on creativity as of late involves the brain and biological correlates of originality, novelty, and insight. Handedness is sometimes used as an indication of hemispheric dominance or hemisphericity, with right-handed people being compared to left-handed people. There are several reports of left-handed persons outnumbering the right-handed in creative and eminent samples. Hemisphericity and other important brain structures and processes contributing to creative thinking and behavior have been studied with EEG, PET, cerebral blood flow, and MRI techniques. Numerous EEG studies suggest that there are particular brain-wave patterns and brain structures that are associated with creative problem solving, or at least specific phases within the problem solving process. EEGs suggest a complex kind of activity while individuals work on divergent thinking tasks. The complexity disappears when those same individuals work on convergent thinking tasks. It is found that the role of the prefrontal cortex in creative thinking and behavior comes from several sources and uses different methodologies.},

  abstract = {The goal of computational neuroscience is to explain in computational terms how brains generate behaviors. Computational models of the brain explore how populations of highly interconnected neurons are formed during development and how they come to represent, process, store, act upon, and become altered by, information present in the environment. Techniques from computer science and mathematics are used to simulate and analyze these computational models and provide links between the widely ranging levels of investigation, from the molecular to the systems levels. Computational neuroscience is a relatively young discipline that is growing rapidly. Most of the models that have been developed thus far have been aimed at interpreting experimental data and providing a conceptual framework for the dynamic properties of neural systems. A more comprehensive theory of brain function should arise as we gain a broader understanding of the computational resources of nervous systems at all levels of organization.},

  abstract = {Sustainability is a wicked problem, which is hard to define in a unique way. It cannot be solved and should be treated in a participatory approach involving as many stakeholders in the process as possible. Participatory modeling is an efficient method for dealing with wicked problems. It involves stakeholders in an open-ended process of shared learning and can be essential for developing sustainable technologies. While there may be various levels of participation, the process evolves around a model of the system at stake. The model is built in interaction with the stakeholders; it provides formalism to synchronize stakeholder thinking and knowledge about the system and to move toward consensus about the possible decision making.},

  abstract = {Entities and processes in complex systems are of diverse nature and operate at various spatial and temporal scales. Hybrid agent-based (AB) and system dynamics (SD) models have been suggested to capture the essence of these systems in a natural and computationally efficient way. However, the integration of the equation-based SD and individual-based AB models is not least challenged by considerable conceptual differences between these models. Examples of tightly integrated and dynamically switching hybrid models are rare. The aim of this paper is to expand on theoretical frameworks of hybrid agent-based and system dynamics models in ecology to support the model design process of dynamically switching hybrid models. We suggested six alternative model designs that switched between the two modelling paradigms. By the example of a fish-plankton lake ecosystem we demonstrated that a well-designed switching hybrid model can be a performant modelling approach that retains relevant spatial and attributive information. Important findings with respect to optimising computational versus predictive performance were (1) the most plausible results were produced by a spatially explicit design based on spatial plankton stocks and fish switching between individual agents and aggregate school-agents, (2) higher levels of aggregation did not necessarily result in higher computational performance, and (3) adaptive, emergence-based triggers for the paradigm switches minimised information loss and could connect hierarchical and spatial scales. In conclusion, we argue to reach beyond efficiency-oriented considerations and use emergent super-individuals as structural elements of dynamically switching hybrid models.},

  abstract = {Publisher Summary
This book about graphic design provides a channel for clear communication that supports visual thinking and acts as an interface to the vast information resources of the modern world. Visual thinking is a process that has the allocation of attention as its very essence. Attention, however, is multifaceted. Making an eye movement is an act of attending. Eye movements are executed to satisfy the need for information and can be thought of as a sequence of visual queries on the visual world. The idea of the visual query is shorthand for what one does when obtaining information either from the world at large or from some kind of information display. Understanding what visual queries are easily executed is a critical skill for the designer. The special skill of designers is not so much skill with drawing or graphic design software, although these are undoubtedly useful, but the talent to analyze a design in terms of its ability to support the visual queries of others. One reason why design is difficult is that the designer already has the knowledge expressed in the design and has seen it develop from inception and therefore cannot see it with fresh eyes. The solution is to be analytic and this is where this book is intended to have value. Effective design should start with a visual task analysis, determine the set of visual queries to be supported by a design, and then use color, form, and space to efficiently serve those queries.},

  abstract = {This study considers the Single Candidate Optimizer (SCO) as an alternative to population-based heuristics, that is faster than them. Although the SCO algorithm is a fast single-candidate-based heuristic, it has certain limitations. To overcome these limitations and enhance the search performance of SCO, several solutions were proposed in this study. First, owing to the single-candidate nature of the SCO, the initial solution position can play a critical role. To compensate for this, an accelerated opposition-learning mechanism was integrated into the SCO. In addition, instead of the equation that is active when the number of unsuccessful improvement attempts is reached in the SCO structure, a mutation operator including chaotic functions (Levy, Gauss, and Cauchy) has been incorporated into the algorithm. Again, equations based on new approaches were added to the SCO algorithm to update the position of the candidate solution during the exploration and exploitation phases. Finally, the standard boundary value control mechanism is replaced with a more effective one. The algorithm developed in this study is named Accelerated Opposition Learning based Chaotic Single Candidate Optimizer (AccOppCSCO), inspired by the accelerated opposition learning mechanism and the mutation operator involving chaotic behaviors. The search capability of the proposed AccOppCSCO algorithm was first analyzed using four different methods: convergence, search history, trajectory, and computational complexity. The effectiveness of the mechanisms used in the AccOppCSCO algorithm for four different two-dimensional benchmark problems from the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation 2014 (CEC2014) package was demonstrated. Subsequently, the performance of the proposed AccOppCSCO algorithm was evaluated on the CEC2014 and IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation 2020 (CEC2020) benchmark problems with different dimensions. The results show that the AccOppCSCO algorithm works effectively in the CEC2014 and CEC2020 test sets and offers better optimization results than SCO. The AccOppCSCO algorithm ranked first in the overall evaluation of the 30-dimensional CEC2014 comparison results with State of the Art (SOTA) heuristics from the literature. Finally, for ten different engineering design problems, the AccOppCSCO algorithm was analyzed and compared with the original SCO and other SOTA heuristics. The results show that AccOppCSCO is effective for engineering design problems. This emphasizes that the algorithm can work effectively on a wide range of problems and can be used in various applications. The source code of the AccOppCSCO algorithm for the CEC2014 benchmark suite is publicly available at https://github.com/uguryuzgec/AccOppCSCO.},

In addition to the overall effectiveness of the game, we investigated the impact of a specific game feature—constraints on the number of blocks in a solution. Results showed that after playing Penguin Go for less than two hours, students' CT skills improved significantly, but the additional constraints did not generate a significant impact on learning. In addition, the game overall did not influence students' attitudes toward computer science, but the constraints condition of the game negatively influenced students' attitudes toward computer science. Implications of the findings and possible directions for future research regarding using these types of games to foster computational thinking skills are discussed.},
