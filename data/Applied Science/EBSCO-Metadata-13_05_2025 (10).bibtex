However, there is an agreement in the scientific literature that important challenges exist, such as keeping student engagement and the requirement of developing problem-solving skills, and not just learning the code syntax. The inclusion of digital Game-Based Learning (GBL) has shown great potential. To better understand how it can be helpful to adult learners in STEM degrees, a study was conducted on the application of two very popular commercial video games in different introductory programming courses at an online university, during the introduction of basic programming topics (CS1). The methods combined a descriptive qualitative and a quantitative approach, using a reflective journals and questionnaires, which helped students consider and express their experiences, how they in",

However, there is little understanding of whether children are developmentally ready to think computationally and what specific CT concepts and skills can be developed at various ages. This study explored the developmental and gender differences in CT skills of 197 Grade 4–6 students (aged 9–13) before being exposed to instruction and investigated the age–gender interaction effects on their CT acquisition in an intervention combining both programming and non‐programming (unplugged) activities. Results show that students' CT skills followed a developmental progression before instruction. Gender difference across ages was insignificant in conditionals, logical operators, pattern recognition and generalization skills. Additionally, students of different ages developed CT differently during the intervention, and their CT acquisition was unaffected by gender. Implication",

However, it is still unclear which teaching methods work in which situations. To provide some clarity in this area, we compared two methods of integrating programming into a primary robotics workshop for learners aged ten to twelve. In one method, students create programs from scratch; in the other, they start with a faulty program they have to fix. These teaching methods were evaluated using the framework of learning ecology, which provides a holistic framework for assessing complex learning environments. We identified different indicators of learning ecology and assessed our workshops using a mixed‐methods approach. Our results showed no difference between the groups on the intrinsic dimension of a learning ecology. However, on the experiential dimension, the learners in the create group scored better ",

However, the output-based assessment in BBPL learning is insufficient as we can not understand how students learn and what mistakes they have had. This study aims to propose a data-driven method that provides insight into students' problem-solving process in a game-based BBPL practice. Based on a large-scale programing dataset generated by 131,770 students in solving a classical maze game with BBPL in Hour of Code, we first conducted statistical analysis to extract the most common mistakes and correction trajectories students had. Furthermore, we proposed a novel program representation method based on tree edit distance of abstract syntax tree to represent students' programing trajectories, then applied a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm to find the hidden patterns behind these trajectories.

Through both quantitative coding of in-game talk and qualitative analysis of discourse exchanges, it was found that seemingly minor modifications to the game resulted in significant differences in the character and amount of computational thinking shown in player discourse.

It is a fun and engaging learning activity that encourages students to collaborate, delve into a problem, construct knowledge, and cultivate critical thinking. Educational robotics is therefore an innovative teaching tool, which contributes to the implementation of the above goal and follows the principles of building, specifically the construction of knowledge (Mikropoulos &amp; Bellou, 2010). It develops students' critical thinking, strengthens their mental models, and activates known learning mechanisms leading them to a deeper level of understanding and assimilation of knowledge, which cannot be accomplished with traditional teaching methodologies. It has also been proven to be able to help students solve complex problems as well as contribute to the development of computational thinking skills (Atmatzid",

However, there is a noticeable gap in understanding its influence on students' cognitive development from a multilevel perspective. This study delves into cognitive learning theories and aims to bridge the existing gap by introducing a three-level conceptual model to illustrate how the influence of SCP on students' cognitive CT abilities is mediated through the cognitive learning processes. This multilevel approach simultaneously explores SCP within the intricate school environment where factors at the school, teacher, and student levels are closely intertwined. Data was collected from 82 programming teachers and their 2433 students across 43 Hong Kong primary schools. Using multilevel modeling, results indicate that the adoption of SCP is significantly anchored by school support on teacher professional development (TPD), which in turn enhan",

Programming environments are now widely adopted in classrooms to teach programming concepts. However, these tools are often reliant on visual interaction, making them inaccessible to children with visual impairments. Also, programming environments in general are usually designed to promote individual experiences, wasting the potential benefits of group collaborative activities. We propose the design of a programming environment that leverages asymmetric roles to foster collaborative computational thinking activities for children with visual impairments, in particular mixed-visual-ability classes.
