Moreover, by learning these skills in the first year, students acquire a powerful tool set that they can use and build on throughout their studies.To address this need, we have developed a first-year undergraduate course that teaches students the foundations of computational thinking and programming in the context of problems in biology. This article describes the structure and content of the course and summarizes assessment data on both affective and learning outcomes.",

Reduction has been recognized to be a difficult topic for students to learn. Previous studies on teaching reduction have concentrated on its use in special courses on the theory of computing. As a fundamental concept, reduction should be discussed multiple times during a curriculum, starting from first-year studies. In order to support this, we propose intuitive analogies based on the metaphor of traveling that could be used as an aid for illuminating key ideas of reductions on introductory computer science courses.",

However, as the amount of data increases, the multi-granularity knowledge space will have a larger number of layers, which will reduce its problem-solving ability. Therefore, we define a knowledge space distance measurement and propose two algorithms to select k representative layers from the multi-granularity knowledge space, where k is specified by the user according to the needs in problem solving, and k representative layers are approximately equidistant. First, we propose a knowledge space distance to measure the distance between any two layers in a multi-granularity knowledge space with superset-subset relationships, and the rationality of the knowledge space distance is verified by theory and experiment. Second, relying on the knowledge space distance and knowledge space distance variance, we propose two algorithms (i.e., a deterministic algorithm and a heuris",

The nature, characteristics, and objectives of aeroacoustics problems are also quite different from the commonly encountered CFD problems. There are computational issues that are unique to aeroacoustics. For these reasons computational aeroacoustics requires somewhat independent thinking and development.

Recently, NISQ devices have been verified as versatile testbeds for simulating open quantum systems and have been used to simulate simple quantum channels. Our goal is to solve the more complicated problem of simulating convex mixtures of single qubit Pauli channels on NISQ devices.

The programs are constructed stepwise along with a specification that is inherently guaranteed to be satisfied. CbC is complex to use without specialized tool support, since it needs a set of predefined refinement rules of fixed granularity which are additional rules on top of the programming language. Each refinement rule introduces a specific programming statement and developers cannot depart from these rules to construct programs. CbC allows to develop software in a structured and incremental way to ensure correctness, but the limited flexibility is a disadvantage of CbC. In this work, we compare classic CbC with CbC-Block and TraitCbC.

 abstract  = "A drastic decline in the number of students that are enrolled for Engineering is now being experienced in developed as well as developing countries. Learning is becoming boring as a generation brought up on technology is losing the ability to pay attention in traditional classes for a long stretch of time. This has led to the idea that other teaching methods do exist and can be applied in teaching/learning. This work leveraged the use of Digital Game-Based Learning (DGBL) in Engineering classrooms to develop a serious game named LogicHouse Version 1 (LogicHouse-V1 or LogicHouse for short). The game, is a web-based serious game prototype that targets selected topics in Digital Electronics course. This course is a core component of undergraduate curriculum in Electrical &amp; Electronics Engineering, Computer Engineering, Information Technology, Communication Engineering, Computer Science and other related Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) courses. LogicHouse involve",

 abstract  = "Children continue to be overlooked as a topic of concern in discussions around the ethical use of people's data and information. Where children are the subject of such discussions, the focus is often primarily on privacy concerns and consent relating to the use of their data. This paper highlights the unique challenges children face when it comes to online interferences with their decision-making, primarily due to their vulnerability, impressionability, the increased likelihood of disclosing personal information online, and their developmental capacities. These traits allow for practices such as hypernudging to be executed on them more accurately and with more serious consequences, specifically by potentially undermining their autonomy. We argue that children are autonomous agents in the making and thus require additional special protections to ensure that the development of their autonomy is safeguarded. This means that measures should be taken to prohibit most forms of hypernudging ",

 abstract  = "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs) now arise in the context of heterogeneous human connectivity and population immunity. Through a large-scale phylodynamic analysis of 115,622 Omicron BA.1 genomes, we identified &gt;6,000 introductions of the antigenically distinct VOC into England and analyzed their local transmission and dispersal history. We find that six of the eight largest English Omicron lineages were already transmitting when Omicron was first reported in southern Africa (22 November 2021). Multiple datasets show that importation of Omicron continued despite subsequent restrictions on travel from southern Africa as a result of export from well-connected secondary locations. Initiation and dispersal of Omicron transmission lineages in England was a two-stage process that can be explained by models of the country√ïs human geography and hierarchical travel network. Our results enable a comparison of the processes that drive the ",

 abstract  = "In recent years, the spike in the amount of information transmitted through communication infrastructures has increased due to the advances in technologies such as cloud computing, vehicular networks systems, the Internet of Things (IoT), etc. As a result, attackers have multiplied their efforts for the purpose of rendering network systems vulnerable. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to improve the security of those network systems. In this study, an IDS framework using Machine Learning (ML) techniques is implemented. This framework uses different types of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), namely, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Simple RNN. To assess the performance of the proposed IDS framework, the NSL-KDD and the UNSW-NB15 benchmark datasets are considered. Moreover, existing IDSs suffer from low test accuracy scores in detecting new attacks as the feature dimension grows. In this study, an XGBoost-based feature selection algorithm was implemented",

 abstract  = "In this paper, a novel metaheuristic called 'The Hiking Optimization Algorithm' (HOA) is proposed. HOA is inspired by hiking, a popular recreational activity, in recognition of the similarity between the search landscapes of optimization problems and the mountainous terrains traversed by hikers. HOA's mathematical model is premised on Tobler's Hiking Function (THF), which determines the walking velocity of hikers (i.e. agents) by considering the elevation of the terrain and the distance covered. THF is employed in determining hikers' positions in the course of solving an optimization problem. HOA's performance is demonstrated by benchmarking with 29 well-known test functions (including unimodal, multimodal, fixed-dimension multimodal, and composite functions), three engineering design problems (EDPs), (including I-beam, tension/compression spring, and gear train problems) and two N-P Hard problems (i.e. Traveling Salesman's and Knapsack Problems). Moreover, HOA's results are verified ",
