 abstract  = "Programming is more than just coding, for, it exposes students to computational thinking which involves problem-solving using computer science concepts like abstraction and decomposition. Even for non-computing majors, computational thinking is applicable and useful in their daily lives. The three dimensions of computational thinking are computational concepts, computational practices and computational perspectives. In recent years, the availability of free and user-friendly programming languages has fuelled the interest of researchers and educators to explore how computational thinking can be introduced in K-12 contexts. Through an analysis of 27 available intervention studies, this paper presents the current trends of empirical research in the development of computational thinking through programming and suggests possible research and instructional implications. From the review, we propose that more K-12 intervention studies centering on computational practices and computational per",

The results indicate that students primarily struggle with understanding loops (both simple and nested), while difficulties with selection structures and sequence structures are less pronounced. Regarding game elements, students face difficulties in interpreting command symbols representing directions, understanding graphical interface elements representing programming constructs, and managing complex user interfaces.

However, in teaching and learning, all three perspectives most often manifest in isolation. We believe this is to the detriment of both educators and students alike.

 abstract  = "This paper presents direction for efficient software education. Due to the impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the whole world is interested in software education. However, simply teaching how to code is not software education. The thinking abilities used in coding for software implementation are even more important. Therefore, computational thinking is getting great attention. Several institutions suggest factors for computational thinking and encourage to teach in a relevant way based on the suggestion. In this study, the verification of the factors they suggested was conducted through a questionnaire. The total of 419 freshman students of the College of Social Sciences who were taking â€œComputational Thinking and Software Codingâ€ class participated in the survey at the beginning and the end of the semester. We first analyzed Wing's proposal that summarized the concept of computational thinking, and reviewed the proposal of ISTE (International Society for Technology in Ed",

In contrast to Computer Science which is generally treated as a distinct field of study, CT as a construct highlights the integral relationship between computing and other fields. Many recent efforts seek to map computational thinking by making high-level connections to other school disciplines. We argue that while these efforts may help identify specific curricular areas in which computing is likely to take place, they do not sufficiently capture the specificity and dynamism that is characteristic of meaningful computational integration. Worse, they exclude generative examples of computing integration that exist outside of the traditional STEM context or researcher-led efforts. In this special issue, we offer a counterproposal to one-size-fits-all frameworks of CT by exploring in detail how local, emergent definitions of CT develop across a diversity of spaces of learning.

 abstract  = "This longitudinal study examined changes in Computational Thinking (CT) skills in first and second grade students exposed to a developmentally appropriate coding curriculum. The "Coding as Another Language" (CAL) curriculum spans seven weeks and uses the KIBO robot to engage students in learning that integrates programming and literacy concepts. We compared children receiving CAL (N = 667) to a control group (N = 181) who participated in typical classroom activities without coding (No-CAL). TechCheck, a validated "unplugged" CT assessment suitable for young children regardless of their coding experience, was used to measure CT. Over the course of the study, children who received CAL-KIBO improved on TechCheck (M change = 0.94, p &lt;.001) whereas the No-CAL group did not change significantly (M change = 0.27, p =.07). Accounting for demographic factors, baseline performance and classroom (teacher) effects, CAL exposure was a significant predictor of post-test CT scores (p &lt;.01). Im",

 abstract  = "Interest in coding education has exploded in the past five years, especially in elementary and early secondary education. Teachers who are largely new to coding are expected to guide entire student bodies through the fundamentals of coding and computational thinking. But little is known about which coding and computational thinking (CT) concepts teachers feel most comfortable with and which concepts they struggle with. This study describes 127 elementary coding teachers' changes in their beliefs about teaching coding and CT as they participated in year-long continuous professional development. Novice elementary coding teachers demonstrated most growth in their self-efficacy for teaching sequences, algorithms and loops. They were less secure in their knowledge of conditionals, variables, and functions. For computational thinking, teachers were most confident in their ability to identify patterns, think algorithmically, understand logic, and evaluate outcomes, showing less growth with d",

There have been attempts to investigate learners' computer programming patterns using high-frequency and automated data collection. This approach can be considered as process-based analysis as opposed to outcome-based analysis (i.e., the use of test or exam scores). In this process-based approach to investigate learners' computer programming process, we included two critical constructs in our research, self-regulated learning and computational thinking skills. We aimed to identify learners' computer programming patterns in the context that novice students learn a computer programming language, Python, in an online coding environment. We examined the relationships between the learners' coding patterns, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills. Initially, we adopted a traditional approach with the aggregate data",

To measure the effectiveness of PPS, the Group Assessment of Logical Thinking and a self-assessment survey pre- and post-test were used. Findings indicated that PPS not only improved students' overall logical thinking as much as did Logo programming learning, but also increased scores on one more subscale of logical thinking than did the Logo course.
