This paper introduces XRCoding, a gamified immersive coding system that merges VR and passive haptic technologies with standard block coding approaches. XRCoding aims to enhance the user experience of block coding, particularly in educational settings, by providing intuitive interfaces and engaging activities. Building upon previous research on gamification, VR, and tangible programming, XRCoding offers a novel approach to teaching computational thinking and coding concepts.

Nonetheless, these tools alone may not ensure the spontaneous and efficient acquisition of concepts and skills in computational thinking (CT). Using mind mapping as a form of scaffolding to facilitate the visualization of abstract thinking processes may enhance the effectiveness of programming instruction. This study therefore investigated the effects of mind mapping-based scaffolding that integrates five CT skills on elementary students' CT development. Eighty-six fifth-grade students participated in our pretest-posttest quasi-experimental study. In the experimental group, mind mapping-based scaffolding was used to help students learn programming, while in the comparison group it was not used.

This study introduced flow design into programming curricula to investigate its impact on undergraduates 'CT skills during pair work. Two types of flow design approaches, construct-by-self flow design (CBS-FD) and construct-on-scaffold flow design (COS-FD), were proposed to determine which approach better enhances students' CT skills. Seventy-six first-year undergraduates participated, including thirty in the CBS group and thirty-six in the COS group. Evaluations made from the results and processes of programming tasks were employed to describe computational performance and computational practices, respectively. Data gathered from CT skill surveys were thoroughly analyzed to gain a deeper understanding of computational perspectives. Our findings highlighted that COS-FD significan",

Despite cumulative research on exploring students' CT acquisition and its influencing factors, learners' development of the skill over time and the underlying mechanism that contributes to individual differences remain unclear. Objective: To bridge this gap, the present study aimed to explore the individual differences in CT acquisition among primary school students and how these differences were shaped over time. Specifically, variations in the development of CT across demographics, including gender and learning experience, were explored. Method: Three waves of data were collected from a sample of 322 primary school students (aged 7–12) across 18 months, with a 9‐month interval between adjacent waves.

In this study, we collected cognitive, affective, and demographic data from 4,142 primary students as features to predict their understanding of computational thinking (CT) concepts. We identified and used five popularly used machine learning models. All five machine learning models outperformed the logistic regression model, with the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model achieving the highest predictive accuracy.
