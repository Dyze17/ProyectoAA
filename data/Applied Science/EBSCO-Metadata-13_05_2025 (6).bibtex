However, there is not consensus on a guiding framework, definition, or set of proxies in which to measure CT. We are addressing this problem by using Evidence Centered Design (ECD) to develop an assessment of kindergarten-aged children's CT. Objective: To present a design case on the development of the assessment, specifically the algorithmic thinking (AT) tasks and to share validity evidence that emerged. Method: We focus on the AT sub-component of CT and present the principled assessment design process using ECD. Findings: Our operationalization of CT includes spatial reasoning as a sub-component. Pilot results showed an acceptable internal consistency reliability for the AT items and critical design decisions that contributed to validity evidence. Implications: An important contribution of this work is the inclusion of spatial reasoning in our definition of early childhood CT.",

Moreover, there is a lack of integration of adaptivity into educational computer games for computational thinking, which is crucial to addressing individual needs in developing computational thinking skills. In this study, we present an adaptive educational computer game, called AutoThinking, for developing students' computational thinking skills in addition to their conceptual knowledge.

We then present a design of a disciplinarily-integrated game that integrates these themes to demonstrate one such possible instantiation of the themes.

We present the results of a quasi-experimental piece of research with sixth-grade students which studies the influence of Scratch both on the acquisition of mathematical concepts, and on the development of computational thinking. The experiment consisted of two different phases, a programming phase linked to the instruction in Scratch and focused on the acquisition of basic concepts of computational thinking (sequences, iterations, conditionals, and events-handling), and a mathematical phase completely oriented towards the resolution of mathematical tasks. In particular, the mathematical phase focused on word problems whose resolution involves the use of the least common multiple and the greatest common divisor. In order to e",

Broad definitions provide many avenues for developing integrated instruction, as practices within existing activities can simply be reframed in terms of CT. But such general use of the term CT may confuse its meaning and dilute its power as a tool for bringing CS to all. In this paper, we take the viewpoint that mathematical thinking and computational thinking share common practices, such as using repetition to accomplish tasks, but these shared ideas may develop differently in mathematics and computer science. We use document analysis to analyze the K-5 Common Core State Standards for Mathematics for the presence of these common practices and describe the specific ways they develop in mathematics.

The advent of interactive ebooks, online sites (e.g. CodeAcademy), youth directed tools (e.g. Scratch, Tynker) and the vast library of open source code, have dramatically changed the landscape of computer programming pedagogy. These tools each purport to address different audiences as well as varying skill sets of student programmers, such as coding literacy and computational thinking, key abilities of successful programmers. However, developing computational thinking, which is similar to generic problem-solving, remains difficult and elusive in many educational programs and online pedagogical tools.

In light of the increasing need to provide students with computational education, this paper presents a novel way to develop computational thinking among students.

 abstract  = "In an era characterised by rapid technological advancement, the application of algorithmic approaches to address complex problems has become crucial across various disciplines. Within the realm of education, there is growing recognition of the pivotal role played by computational thinking (CT). This skill set has emerged as indispensable in our ever-evolving digital landscape, accompanied by an equal need for effective methods to assess and measure these skills. This research places its focus on the Cross Array Task (CAT), an educational activity designed within the Swiss educational system to assess students' algorithmic skills. Its primary objective is to evaluate pupils' ability to deconstruct complex problems into manageable steps and systematically formulate sequential strategies. The CAT has proven its effectiveness as an educational tool in tracking and monitoring the development of CT skills throughout compulsory education. Additionally, this task presents an enthralling avenu",

 abstract  = "Computational thinking is widely recognized as an essential skill for adapting to the current era, with programming learning being the most effective means to develop it. It is recommended that computational thinking and learning programming be introduced as early as elementary school. However, elementary school students often possess limited prior knowledge of programming, posing challenges in their learning process. The graphic organizers (GOs) may serve as a bridge between students' existing knowledge and new learning, facilitating a deeper processing of the overall information and thereby enhancing the learning process. This can be particularly advantageous for early-stage learners when grappling with difficult subjects. Consequently, this study employed GOs to assist elementary school students in their computational thinking and programming learning, employing a quasi-experiment design to evaluate their effectiveness.

We designed a professional development activity for elementary teachers to embed CT within science and examined how their understanding of CT emerged over the course of PD. This paper reports results from qualitative analysis of teacher responses to vignettes and open-ended questions, which presented teaching scenarios related to CT. We found that the vignettes allow us to see shift in teachersâ€™ thinking about CT from broad and generalized ideas to more elaborate versions of those ideas. We discuss that while vignettes provided a good method to portray changes in teacher views about CT, we need additional mechanisms to monitor how teachers conceptualize and come to integrate computational thinking into elementary schools.",

A sample of 287 primary school students in grades four to six completed a corresponding survey. Confirmatory factor analysis validated the proposed components of the programming empowerment instrument. A structural equation model indicated that students with greater interest in programming perceived it as more meaningful, had greater impact, had greater creative self-efficacy, and had greater programming self-efficacy. Also, students with attitudes toward collaboration that were more positive than others had greater creative self-efficacy. Boys showed more interest in programming than girls did. Students in higher grade levels than others viewed programming as less meaningful and had lower programming self-efficacy. These results supp",

In this paper we present the design and evaluation of a Game Design Workshop aimed at teenagers with Autism Spectrum Disorders.

However, in psychological terms, CT is still a poorly defined construct, given that its nomological network has not been established yet. In a previous paper, we started to address this issue studying the correlations between CT and some fundamental cognitive variables, such as primary mental abilities and problem-solving ability. The current work deepens in the same direction as it aims to extend the nomological network of CT with non-cognitive factors, through the study of the correlations between CT, self-efficacy and the several dimensions from the ‘Big Five’ model of human personality: Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism.
