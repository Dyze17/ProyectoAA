The aim of this study is to assess the use of a Visual Programming Language using Scratch in classroom practice, analyzing the outcomes and attitudes of 107 primary school students from 5th to 6th grade in five different schools in Spain. The intervention takes place in two academic years analyzing the practice of integrating coding and visual blocks programming in sciences and arts. The “Computational concepts and computational practices” dimension details a quasi-experimental approach, which showed significant improvement regarding learning programming concepts, logic, and computational practices with an active approach.

The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is beginning to transform education in various areas, from course materials to assessment systems. This requires educators to reconsider how they evaluate students' knowledge. It is crucial to understand if and to what extent assignments can be completed using AI tools. This study explores two hypotheses about the risks of using code-based 3D modeling software in education and the potential for students to delegate their work to AI when completing assignments. We selected two tasks that students were able to successfully complete independently and provided the same amount of information (both textual and image) to AI in order to generate the necessary code. We tested the widely used ChatGPT and Gemini AI bots to assess their current performance in generating code based on text prompts or image-based information for the two models. Our finding",

In case of programming education for non-majors conducted in the liberal arts at universities, if it is conducted online using high-quality contents, problems such as the shortage of professional professor and the limitation of practice time can be solved. Also, it has the advantage of providing students with enough time to think and solve problems. In this paper, the possibility of online lectures was investigated through a survey before and after lectures in software liberal arts courses conducted online. From the results of the survey, it is judged that the goal of software education can be achieved even if software lectures are conducted online, which is to improve computational thinking and problem-solving skills.",

Here, we test the effects of units with different programming content within a virtual robotics context on both learning gains and motivational changes in middle school (6th–8th grade) robotics classrooms. Significant learning gains were found overall, particularly for groups introduced to content involving program flow, the structural logic of program execution. Relative gains for these groups were particularly high on items that require the transfer of knowledge to dissimilar contexts. Reaching units that included program flow content was also associated with greater maintenance of programming interest when compared with other units. Therefore, our results suggest that explicit instruction in the structural logic of programming may develop deeper transferrable programming knowledge and prevent declines in some motivational factor",

 abstract  = "Background: Several attitude scales have been developed to measure students' attitudes toward computer programming, including the prominent one developed by Cetin and Ozden. The development of these scales stemmed from the elusive nature of attitude and the lack of specific constructs to measure attitude. These instruments measure students' attitudes based on one‐dimensional perspective, thus, making it difficult to interpret the meaning of some attitude evaluations such as the meaning of neutral points in a 10‐point scale (for example). Objectives: The computer programming attitude scale was modified to measure ambivalence. The study also investigate attitude differences across demographic variables and used these variables to predict ambivalence. Methods: The study was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, the instrument was validated using exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. In the second phase, the revised scale was administered to another 547 stud",

This study examined elementary school children's performance and attitudes during and toward an online programming learning activity utilizing the pair-programming Agile method that may foster 21st-century skills, including collaboration and computational thinking. Forty 4th–6th grade children with basic programming knowledge of Scratch were randomly assigned to either a pair-programming or solo-programming condition. Overall, children in both conditions enjoyed the online learning activity and completed it successfully. In particular, pair-programming seemed to entail an extra benefit to girls who generally preferred working in pairs. Nevertheless, children in the pair condition took longer to complete all tasks, perceived the third task, which was completed individually, as more difficult, and were less active when their partner was more competent.

 abstract  = "Reintroducing computer science (CS) education in K–12 schools to promote computational thinking (CT) has attracted significant attention among scholars and educators. Among the several essential components included in CS and CT education, program debugging is an indispensable skill. However, debugging teaching has often been overlooked in K–12 contexts, and relevant empirical studies are lacking in the literature. Moreover, novices generally have poor performance in domain knowledge and strategic knowledge concerning debugging. They also consistently experience a high cognitive burden in debugging learning. To address these gaps, we developed a flipped systematic debugging approach combined with a systematic debugging process (SDP) and the modeling method. A quasi-experimental study was conducted to explore the effectiveness of this flipped systematic debugging approach, in which 83 fifth-grade students attended the flipped debugging training lessons with the SDP–modeling method, and ",

Hippocampal place cells are involved in goal-directed spatial navigation and the consolidation of spatial memories. Recently, Gauthier and Tank (Neuron 99(1):179–193, 2018. 10.1016/j.neuron.2018.06.008) have identified a subpopulation of hippocampal cells selectively activated in relation to rewarded goals. However, the relationship between these cells' spiking activity and goal representation remains elusive. We analyzed data from experiments in which rats underwent five consecutive tasks in which reward locations and spatial context were manipulated. We found CA1 populations with properties continuously ranging from place cells to reward cells. Specifically, we found typical place cells insensitive to reward locations, reward cells that only fired at correct rewarded feeders in each task regardless of context, and "hybrid cells" that responded to spatial location",

The results prove that the form is cost-effective and that the environmental impact caused by associated production and distribution processes would be comparatively reduced. Computational research based on parametric design thinking enabled the relationship between form properties as selected design parameters to be evaluated, with the aim of ensuring that efficiency does not compromise technical requirements and that the overall functional role of the concrete block is appropriate when used as a constituent material in nonstructural wall construction.
