However, the compatibility between games and instruction is often insufficient to accommodate the entertaining and educational nature of the curriculum entirely, and the benefits of game-based learning could be compromised. Therefore, this study proposed a role-playing-based micro-game strategy for developing students' CT in a Python programming course, and designed a quasi-experiment to verify the effectiveness of the role-playing-based micro-game strategy. A total of 133 eighth-grade students from schools in eastern China were randomly divided into experimental and control groups.

CT is a critical reasoning process whereby people formulate and solve problems using computers. CT education relies not only on schools and teachers, but also on parents. We reviewed 34 studies of the influence of parents on their children's CT education.

Two theoretical frameworks, the tripartite model and parental involvement theory, were used to synthesize the 34 articles to analyze parents' affective, behavioral, and cognitive participation out",

Therefore, a systematic review of CL in CT classes would provide practical guidance on teaching strategies to enhance CT interventions and improve the quality of teaching and learning, ultimately benefiting students' CT skills development. To address this gap, this study examined 43 empirical studies that have applied CL strategies, ranging from 2006 to 2022. Several findings were revealed in the analysis.

It is a key skill for children in the 21st century. However, it is unclear how CT can be developed most effectively in children. Several pedagogical methodologies have been proposed and are being investigated. The main aim of this paper is to test the hypothesis which states that using three‐dimensional (3D) simulated robots helps in the learning of programming and CT concepts, such as directions, loops, conditionals, and functions. The research questions are: Does this hypothesis hold true? Are some concepts easier or better learned than others and to what extent? The goal is to measure and evaluate the effect of using as a learning tool a platform with 3D simulated robots and realistic physics, and compare it with the standard Scratch learning tool which does not use robotics but a two‐dimensional (2D) car",

Graphical programming is the common way to develop CT in primary students, but this drag-and-drop programming may weaken students' understanding of programming's abstract concepts and code logic. Text-based programming approaches can solve the problems faced by graphical programming, but few studies have explored the impact of text-based programming on CT. Therefore, we conducted a quasi-experimental study with 98 6th graders to explore the impact of gamified Python programming on CT. The findings showed that CT skills, as well as abstraction and decomposition, pattern recognition and evaluation in CT sub-skills, were significantly higher with students in the experimental group than in the control group. Furthermore, we found that gamified Python programming enabled boys and girls to reach the same level of CT skills. However, in terms of CT sub-skills, we found that gami",

Objectives: The current study examines how a series of Arduino‐based robotics learning activities capture the fuller essence of concepts related to CT. Methods: College students (n = 50) completed a series of six robotics learning activities. Think‐alouds, student reflections and performance scores were used to assess students' CT through a robotics challenge in virtual and physical learning environments. Results and Conclusions: Students verbalized CT concepts related to algorithmic thinking much more than abstraction, problem decomposition and testing and debugging.

 abstract  = "Background: Computational thinking (CT) has been broadly considered one of the 21st‐century competencies, and an emerging trend has been seen in integrating CT into primary education. Cumulative research was conducted to investigate the influencing factors of CT learning performance, and an ample range of factors has been identified, involving both cognitive and non‐cognitive facets. However, limited has been done in exploring the non‐cognitive factors, and even less at the primary education level. Objective: To address this gap, this study bridged CT with personality in the primary school context, and more importantly, it proposed a mediator in the personality‐CT relationship that is, attitudinal beliefs, which are amenable to change, thereby allowing further support for nurturing the traits. Method: Based on the Big Five model of personality, standard tests were administered to a sample of 434 primary school students (ages 8–11), and data were analysed using structural equation mode",

Although the significance of CT has been highlighted, it could be challenging for educators to teach CT. Fortunately, adopting robots in education has been evidenced to be of benefit to promoting students' learning motivation, CT, and higher-order thinking skills. However, several significant factors affecting students' programming performances in robot-assisted learning activities have been identified, such as cognitive needs and organization. In this study, a CMR-BBP (concept map robot block-based programming) approach was designed by integrating concept maps into robot block-based programming to enhance students' programming learning. Moreover, a three-group experiment was carried out in an elementary school to evaluate their learning outcomes. The experimental results revealed that the CMR-BBP approach benefited the students' perceptions of their computational thinking ",
