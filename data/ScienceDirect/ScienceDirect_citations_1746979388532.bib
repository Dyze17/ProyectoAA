abstract = {Does positive thinking predict variance in school grades over and above that predicted by cognitive ability? Six hundred and thirty nine high school students participated in a three-year longitudinal study that predicted grades using cognitive ability and three positive thinking variables – self-esteem, hope, and attributional style. Hope, positive attributional style and cognitive ability predicted higher grades, whilst self-esteem was a less consistent predictor of academic performance. Structural equation modelling revealed significant paths from cognitive ability, gender, and a second order positive thinking factor to grades. The results suggest that intelligence, gender, and positive thinking each play a unique role in predicting academic performance in youth. Some suggestions for further research are made.}

abstract = {Lateral motion of material relative to the regional thermal and kinematic frameworks is important in the interpretation of thermochronology in convergent orogens. Although cooling ages in denuded settings are commonly linked to exhumation, such data are not related to instantaneous behavior but rather to an integration of the exhumation rates experienced between the thermochronological ‘closure’ at depth and subsequent exposure at the surface. The short spatial wavelength variation of thermal structure and denudation rate typical of orogenic regions thus renders thermochronometers sensitive to lateral motion during exhumation. The significance of this lateral motion varies in proportion with closure temperature, which controls the depth at which isotopic closure occurs, and hence, the range of time and length scales over which such data integrate sample histories. Different chronometers thus vary in the fundamental aspects of the orogenic character to which they are sensitive. Isotopic systems with high closure temperature are more sensitive to exhumation paths and the variation in denudation and thermal structure across a region, while those of lower closure temperature constrain shorter-term behaviour and more local conditions. Discounting lateral motion through an orogenic region and interpreting cooling ages purely in terms of vertical exhumation can produce ambiguous results because variation in the cooling rate can result from either change in kinematics over time or the translation of samples through spatially varying conditions. Resolving this ambiguity requires explicit consideration of the physical and thermal framework experienced by samples during their exhumation. This can be best achieved through numerical simulations coupling kinematic deformation to thermal evolution. Such an approach allows the thermochronological implications of different kinematic scenarios to be tested, and thus provides an important means of assessing the contribution of lateral motion to orogenic evolution.}

Traditional thinking into this phenomenon had previously included only onshore winds as effective drivers of this transfer. Recent research by the authors, however, has shown that offshore air-flow too can contribute significantly, through lee-side back eddies, to the overall windblown sediment budget to coastal dunes. Under rising sea levels and increased erosion scenarios, this is an important process in any post-storm recovery of sandy beaches. Until now though, full visualisation in 3D of this newly recognised mechanism in offshore flows has not been achieved. Here, we show for the first time, this return flow eddy system using 3D computational fluid dynamics modelling, and reveal the presence of complex corkscrew vortices and other phenomena. The work highlights the importance of relatively small surface undulations in the dune crest which act to induce the spatial patterns of airflow (and transport) found on the adjacent beach.}

Contrary to our expectations, the first study (n=95) indicated that ability to identify emotions in faces and images was negatively related to idea generation ability. The second study (n=100) including a measure of alexithymia confirmed this relation. Moreover, evaluating emotional creativity, we observed a significant negative link between the ability to identify emotions and the tendency to experience emotions differently from those of others.

In contrast, our method is fundamentally different since we employ a psychoanalysis-based approach; in particular, we use the notion of Lacanian discourse types, to capture and deeply understand real (possibly elusive) characteristics, qualities and contents of texts, and evaluate their reliability. As far as we know, this is the first time computational methods are systematically combined with psychoanalysis. We believe such psychoanalytic framework is fundamentally more effective than standard methods, since it addresses deeper, quite primitive elements of human personality, behaviour and expression which usually escape methods functioning at “higher”, conscious layers. In fact, this research is a first attempt to form a new paradigm of psychoanalysis-driven interactive technologies, with broader impact and diverse applications. To exemplify this generic approach, we apply it to the case-study of fake news detection; we first demonstrate certain limitations of the well-known Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality type method, and then propose and evaluate our new method of analysing user texts and detecting fake news based on the Lacanian discourses psychoanalytic approach.}

abstract = {Introduction
Modern computers often use programs that incorporate a programming technique called Object Oriented Programming (OOP), allowing users to manipulate complex ‘computational objects’ such as menus, screen windows, etc with very little effort, say the click of a mouse. OOP deals with structures called objects and allows time and computational effort saving devices such as inheritance, polymorphism and encapsulation. We examine whether the brain itself may use OOP and if representation of objects suffers a breakdown in schizophrenia.
Review of literature
Previous models fail to provide a unifying explanation with a computational basis that could explain the psychopathology in schizophrenia. METHODS Using the object oriented programming language JavaTM we designed a system of self-objects named ‘hand’, ‘action monitor’ etc interacting with non-self objects ‘scissors’, ‘hammer’, ‘wall’, etc. In computational experiments, we allow the ‘action monitor’ to fail; the features of disparate objects are allowed to merge, some features of an object are allowed to be shared with other objects, etc.
Results
By transposing only a few lines of code, it is possible to duplicate various features of the psychopathology of schizophrenia.
Discussion
Our model can demonstrate overinclusion (overabstraction), concrete thinking (underabstraction), loss of ego boundaries (conjoining of disparate objects), delusions (misattribution of object function), lack of insight (poor monitoring of object activity) and passivity (loss of monitoring and misattribution of object activity).
Conclusion
The brain must use the OOP model in its computations. Failure of object representation and manipulation must lie at the core of the psychopathology of schizophrenia.}

The introduction of the base isolation system has led to a new concept in the construction panorama in terms of human life safety, a new way of thinking on new constructions, improvement and retrofitting on existent structures. Therefore, rubber and friction isolators have been deeply investigated to hence performances and predict dynamic behaviour during an earthquake. While the response of the former is characterised by the composition of the elastomeric compound, the latter features special materials able to dissipate energy by moving on smooth surfaces. This paper focuses on friction pendulum devices and addresses its attention on the behaviour of sliding materials. It is well-known that stick-slip phenomenon occurs when friction excitation is present and, in the anti-seismic field is important to reduce it and have a well-representative mathematical law able to describe it. Therefore, Hirun International after performing several treatments of the sliding materials has set up a special processing to guarantee a stable response of the HI-M material used on pendulum devices. The paper, after a brief presentation of the special sliding material, shows a comparison between the material with and without the treatment in terms of the force-displacement law. The paper also analyses in detail the cinematic behaviour of the sliding pendulum with one or two main sliding surfaces, with and without central articulation and determines the stress distribution in the sliding surfaces for the different cases.}

Knowledge complexity poses a problem to the modeller of representation and, in turn, of reasoning. We seek to overcome this problem by using our ‘privileged’ sense of vision. This means that we render dynamic, multi-modal phenomena as graphic depictions, be they technical visualizations, thought experiments, logic constructions or network graphs. The ‘graphic act’ has been described a being a fundamental activity in human perception, and both scientists and artists have undertaken advanced analyses of the human perception of nature based on visual experiments. Analysis based on reasoning is similarly a graphic act, in the sense that it seeks out patterns of connectivity among socio-spatial agents and entities. Reasoning also depends upon symbolism, which serves to overcome the problem of infinity in nature (a matter that lies at the heart of machine computation). Hence, this chapter introduces some elements in logical reasoning, set theory and computation, and outlines the particular importance of working with symbols. It also provides an introduction to data modelling with graphs, including current advances in graph databases. It provides some ‘tools for thinking’ about knowledge complexity and suggests the potential power in adapting these technologies to organize knowledge of dynamic, complex domains. It also introduces some standard methods for spatial data modelling, including powerful surface network models, which borrow from physical landscape analysis, to support reasoning about knowledge-driven domains.}

Although Global Positioning Systems (GPS) are the most widely used method for drone localization, they are not always reliable and accurate in some scenarios. A recent study explores the visual-based positioning method, using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to match geometric features for drone positioning. The authors use an orthophotomap obtained from an actual drone to evaluate their algorithm. This can reduce the gap between research and practical operation. However, the approach overlooks the impact of lighting variations on positioning performance, i.e., brightness and color temperature. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CNN architecture to handle lighting variations. Our method improves reliability, accuracy, and computational complexity under varying lighting conditions by incorporating several critical components into the network. Remarkably, our architecture has only 51.35% trainable parameters and 83.97% floating point operations (FLOPs) of the existing one. Still, we can exceed it by 3.73% while not considering light variations and average 2.36% while considering light variations. The experimental results, also derived from an orthophotomap obtained via an actual drone, demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the challenges induced by lighting changes, ensuring reliable and accurate drone localization.}

It introduces the terms ‘scale’ and ‘scaling’ as methodological metaphors for a researcher’s planned, yet contingent movement through formations of digital textual data that differ in terms of volume, method of collection, processing, and analysis. ‘Scaling-as-method’ aims to replace static binaries (such as ‘micro’ and ‘macro’, ‘small’ and ‘big’ data, ‘manual’ and ‘automated’ processing) by the vision of a researcher who shifts their degree of abstraction, or ‘distance’, towards digital data, while moving from close to distant reading and back again. The paper exemplifies this three-stage process on the example of the indignation mark, aka <!!1>, a twist on the iterated exclamation mark that is attested in digital discourse in various languages as a cue of double-voicing. The explorative examination of a small dataset (Stage 1) leads to the computational collection and distributional analysis of a much larger dataset (‘scaling up’, Stage 2), followed by the manual annotation of a selected subset of this data (‘scaling down’, Stage 3). Each stage draws on a different amount of data, which enables different techniques of processing and analysis, and relies on a specific combination of abductive, deductive, and inductive reasoning. Yet all three stages complement one another in a kaleidoscopic way towards understanding connections between punctuation practices and participatory political discourse online. Scaling as method is not a closed recipe, but an adaptable procedure that can be applied to a variety of discrete digital features. It does not aim to replace established methods of computational social media analysis, but to boost research that is predominantly based on the manual collection and annotation of social media data, and to enables a dialogue between multiple understandings of context.}

This article is about the neural conundrum behind the slowness of human behavior. The information throughput of a human being is about 10 bits/s. In comparison, our sensory systems gather data at ∼109 bits/s. The stark contrast between these numbers remains unexplained and touches on fundamental aspects of brain function: what neural substrate sets this speed limit on the pace of our existence? Why does the brain need billions of neurons to process 10 bits/s? Why can we only think about one thing at a time? The brain seems to operate in two distinct modes: the “outer” brain handles fast high-dimensional sensory and motor signals, whereas the “inner” brain processes the reduced few bits needed to control behavior. Plausible explanations exist for the large neuron numbers in the outer brain, but not for the inner brain, and we propose new research directions to remedy this.}

abstract = {Based on multiple levels of granularity, the notion of sequential three-way granular computing focuses on a multiple stages of thinking, problem-solving, and information processing in threes. This paper interprets, represents, and implements sequential three-way granular computing by a framework of temporal-spatial multi-granularity learning, which is described with the temporality of data and the spatiality of parameters. In real-world decision-making, such a sequential approach is useful to make faster decisions for some objects with the lower cost of decision process and the acceptable accuracy when information is insufficient or unavailable. However, the cost of time-consuming computation for hierarchical multilevel granularity is our concern. To address this issue, we utilize a local strategy to accelerate a sequence of neighborhood-based granulation induced by Gaussian kernel function. Subsequently, local three-way decision rules are investigated based on the Bayesian minimum risk criterion. Moreover, by the construction of a novel local trisection model, we propose a local sequential approach of three-way granular computing under a temporal-spatial multilevel granular structure. Finally, a series of comparative experiments between global and local perspectives is carried out to verify the effectiveness of our proposed models.}

We also find stocks of knowledge or experience (crystallized intelligence) predict sunk cost behavior, rather than algorithmic thinking (fluid intelligence) or the personality trait of openness. We construct and validate a scale, the “SCE-8”, which encompasses many resources individuals can spend, and offers researchers an efficient way to measure susceptibility to the sunk cost effect.}

New, artificial pathways promise higher yields and activity than natural ones like the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle. The question remains how to best predict their in vivo performance and what actually makes one pathway “better” than another. In this context, we explore aerobic carbon fixation pathways by a computational approach and compare them based on their specific activity and yield on methanol, formate, and CO2/H2 considering the kinetics and thermodynamics of the reactions. Besides pathways found in nature or implemented in the laboratory, this included two completely new cycles with favorable features: the reductive citramalyl-CoA cycle and the 2-hydroxyglutarate-reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle. A comprehensive kinetic data set was collected for all enzymes of all pathways, and missing kinetic data were sampled with the Parameter Balancing algorithm. Kinetic and thermodynamic data were fed to the Enzyme Cost Minimization algorithm to check for respective inconsistencies and calculate pathway-specific activities. The specific activities of the reductive glycine pathway, the CETCH cycle, and the new reductive citramalyl-CoA cycle were predicted to match the best natural cycles with superior product-substrate yield. However, the CBB cycle performed better in terms of activity compared to the alternative pathways than previously thought. We make an argument that stoichiometric yield is likely not the most important design criterion of the CBB cycle. Still, alternative carbon fixation pathways were paretooptimal for specific activity and product-substrate yield in simulations with C1 substrates and CO2/H2 and therefore hold great potential for future applications in Industrial Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology.}

Despite the wide adoptions, mechanistic models are challenged by the complexity of dynamic processes and high computational demands. Data-driven models bring opportunities to capture system complexities and reduce computational cost, by leveraging the abundant data made available by recent advance in sensor technologies. However, the interpretability and data availability hinder their wider adoption. This paper advocates for a paradigm shift in the application of data-driven models within the context of UWS. Integrating existing mechanistic knowledge into data-driven modeling offers a unique solution that reduces data requirements and enhances model interpretability. The knowledge-informed approach balances model complexity with dataset size, enabling more efficient and interpretable modeling in UWS. Furthermore, the integration of mechanistic and data-driven models offers a more accurate representation of UWS dynamics, addressing lingering uncertainties and advancing modelling capabilities. This paper presents perspectives and conceptual framework on developing and implementing knowledge-informed data-driven modeling, highlighting their potential to improve UWS management in the digital era.}

Persecutory delusions are among the most common delusions in schizophrenia and represent the extreme end of the paranoia continuum. Paranoia is accompanied by significant worry and distress. Identifying cognitive mechanisms underlying paranoia is critical for advancing treatment. We hypothesized that aberrant belief updating, which is related to paranoia in human and animal models, would also contribute to persecutory beliefs in individuals with schizophrenia.
Methods
Belief updating was assessed in 42 participants with schizophrenia and 44 healthy control participants using a 3-option probabilistic reversal learning task. Hierarchical Gaussian Filter was used to estimate computational parameters of belief updating. Paranoia was measured using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the revised Green et al. Paranoid Thoughts Scale. Unusual thought content was measured with the Psychosis Symptom Rating Scale and the Peters et al. Delusions Inventory. Worry was measured using the Dunn Worry Questionnaire.
Results
Paranoia was significantly associated with elevated win-switch rate and prior beliefs about volatility both in schizophrenia and across the whole sample. These relationships were specific to paranoia and did not extend to unusual thought content or measures of anxiety. We observed a significant indirect effect of paranoia on the relationship between prior beliefs about volatility and worry.
Conclusions
This work provides evidence that relationships between belief updating parameters and paranoia extend to schizophrenia, may be specific to persecutory beliefs, and contribute to theoretical models implicating worry in the maintenance of persecutory delusions.}

An analytical solution is found to the resulting ODE for a specific choice of one of the hardening model’s parameters. That solution is used to prove that if the prescribed density rise is allowed to be infinitely thin, i.e., like a shock in the mathematical sense, the resulting deviatoric stress is still bounded. In other words, the singularity is integrable; integration of the radial return ODE regularizes the infinite strain rate and resulting yield stress in the presence of an ideal shock singularity. The analytical tools developed for this line of thinking are applied to study the variation of deviatoric stress through a nearly shock-like density rise using different density rise profiles, revealing the impact of the shape choice. The tools are also used to compute what rise times are needed to converge upon the correct value of deviatoric stress through a shock; the results indicate that most contemporary hydrocodes cannot be expected to achieve those rise times. A demonstration of connecting the analytical tools to a hydrocode, using surrogate numerical shock shapes, is provided thereby opening the door for using such surrogates to perform sub-grid computations of converged shock behavior for strain-rate hardening materials.}

Molecular modeling covers a wide range of techniques and the calculation of an even wider range of properties. Although for polymers, the possibility of treating a polymer chain quantum mechanically is formidable, it is clear that the modeling approach allows calculations on monomers, dimmers, and oligomers to guide the interpretation of many spectroscopic observations with great success. For those systems, where longer times scales and larger size scales are important, molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics methods are available, but the issue of the force field and the approximations that it introduces remain significant. The key to the change in attitude to modeling and its role have to lie in the availability of mature algorithms with well-known and well-understood properties. The density functional theory method in quantum mechanics has introduced a new era in applications of quantum mechanical methods.}

These studies were constrained by their reliance on self-report questionnaires as a means of collecting and analysing data. To address this limitation, this study aimed to employ eye-tracking and retrospective think-aloud techniques to identify differences in SRL strategy use for program comprehension tasks between high-performing students (N = 31) and low-performing students (N = 31) in an undergraduate programming course. All participants attended individual eye-tracking sessions to comprehend two Python program codes with different constructs. Their eye-tracking data and video-recalled retrospective think-aloud data were captured and recorded for analysis. The findings reveal that higher-order cognitive skills, such as elaboration and critical thinking, were mostly adopted by high-performing students, while basic cognitive and resource management strategy, such as rehearsal and help-seeking, were mostly employed by low-performing students when comprehending the program codes. This study not only demonstrates the design of combining eye-tracking and retrospective think-aloud data to explore students’ use of SRL strategies but also provides evidence to support the notion that program comprehension is a complex process that cannot be effectively addressed by employing merely rudimentary strategies, such as repetitively reading the same code segment. In the future, researchers could explore the possibility of using a webcam to monitor and assess students’ online programming processes and provide feedback based on their eye movements. They could also examine the effects of SRL strategies training on students’ motivation, engagement, and performance in various types of programming activities.}

In an array of PV modules it is possible to observe multiple peaks in the power versus voltage (P-V) curve due to the current versus voltage (I–V) PV cell mismatch caused by differences in the received irradiance, such as occurs during partial shading. In these circumstances, the ability of the MPPT devices to track the global MPP of the PV array directly influences the system efficiency. In the literature, various MPPT techniques have been proposed. Among them, computational intelligence (CI) algorithm based MPPT methods have demonstrated the ability to find the global MPP. This paper presents a detailed and specific review of CI- based MPPT techniques. Each method type is classified into one of several subcategories according to its application strategy. The various ways of applying CI into MPPTs are analyzed in detail. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed and compared. The purpose of this study is to provide a compendium on CI-based MPPT techniques for users to understand and select an appropriate method based on application requirements and system constraints.}

Most complex diseases arise on a background of genetics, lifestyle and environment factors, and manifest themselves as a spectrum of symptoms. To fathom intricate biological processes and their changes from healthy to disease states, we need to systematically integrate and analyze multi-omics datasets, ontologies, and diverse annotations. Without proper management of such complex biological and clinical data, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms alone cannot be effectively trained, validated, and successfully applied to provide trustworthy and patient-centric diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Precision medicine requires to use multi-omics approaches effectively, and offers many opportunities for using AI, “big data” analytics, and integrative computational biology workflows. Advances in optical and biochemical assay technologies including sequencing, mass spectrometry and imaging modalities have transformed research by empowering us to simultaneously view all genes expressed, identify proteome-wide changes, and assess interacting partners of each individual protein within a dynamically changing biological system, at an individual cell level. While such views are already having an impact on our understanding of healthy and disease conditions, it remains challenging to extract useful information comprehensively and systematically from individual studies, ensure that signal is separated from noise, develop models, and provide hypotheses for further research. Data remain incomplete and are often poorly connected using fragmented biological networks. In addition, statistical and machine learning models are developed at a cohort level and often not validated at the individual patient level. Combining integrative computational biology and AI has the potential to improve understanding and treatment of diseases by identifying biomarkers and building explainable models characterizing individual patients. From systematic data analysis to more specific diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers, drug mechanism of action, and patient selection, such analyses influence multiple steps from prevention to disease characterization, and from prognosis to drug discovery. Data mining, machine learning, graph theory and advanced visualization may help identify diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers, and create causal models of disease. Intertwining computational prediction and modeling with biological experiments leads to faster, more biologically and clinically relevant discoveries. However, computational analysis results and models are going to be only as accurate and useful as correct and comprehensive are the networks, ontologies and datasets used to build them. High quality, curated data portals provide the necessary foundation for translational research. They help to identify better biomarkers, new drugs, precision treatments, and should lead to improved patient outcomes and their quality of life. Intertwining computational prediction and modeling with biological experiments, efficiently and effectively leads to more useful findings faster.}

This chapter discusses the process of thinking and knowing. Forming concepts, propositions, problems, and directions are examples of thinking. Thinking can be visual, verbal, or abstract. It can be chaotic or orderly, creative, or routine. Thinking of any kind is an activity of some plastic neural systems. Of all mental activities, thinking is probably the one most affected by chemical changes and changes in basic properties of neurons. For example, humans unable to oxidize the amino acid phenylalanine cannot think, thyroid hypofunction produces cretinism, and normal subjects cannot think straight when in states of extreme stress, which are often states of hormonal imbalance, or when under the action of psychotropic drugs. The chapter also discusses the concept of cognition. All cognition is learned but not every learned item is of a cognitive nature. All cognition is cognition of some object, concrete or conceptual, and it consists in some information about its object—complete or partial, true or false. Cognition can be behavioral, perceptual, or conceptual.}

Reviewing the broader literature in design and other disciplines further reveals that discussions of design co-evolution are disconnected from the history of relevant concepts in design research, and disconnected from a range of relevant concepts in other disciplines that describe creative work. Here I examine what the different concepts of design co-evolution are, how they have been modified and what they are related to. This leads to questioning the distinction between problems and solutions, defining them in relative terms, and drawing a connection between design co-evolution and design fixation.}

For the first time, we show here how these steps can be addressed simultaneously using the null-collision concept. This opens the door to the design of Monte Carlo codes directly estimating radiative transfer observables from spectroscopic databases. The intermediate step of producing accurate high-resolution absorption spectra is no longer required. A Monte Carlo algorithm is proposed and applied to six one-dimensional test cases. It allows the computation of spectrally integrated intensities (over 25cm−1 bands or the full IR range) in a few seconds, regardless of the retained database and line model. But free parameters need to be selected and they impact the convergence. A first possible selection is provided in full detail. We observe that this selection is highly satisfactory for quite distinct atmospheric and combustion configurations, but a more systematic exploration is still in progress.}

The theoretical approach includes Green’s function formulations, Wiener–Hopf methods that solve the mixed boundary-value problem, Howe’s and Amiet’s models that relate the wall pressure spectrum to acoustic radiation. Recent analytical developments for poroelasticity and serrations are also included. We discuss a hierarchy of numerical approaches that range from semi-empirical schemes that estimate the wall pressure spectrum using mean-flow and turbulence statistics to high-fidelity unsteady flow simulations such as Large Eddy Simulation (LES) or Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) that resolve the sound generation and scattering process based on the first-principles flow physics. Wind tunnel experimental research that provided benchmark data for numerical simulations and unravel flow physics is reviewed. In each theoretical, numerical, and experimental approach, noise control methods for mitigating trailing-edge noise are discussed. Finally, highlights of practical applications of trailing-edge noise prediction and reduction to wind turbine noise, fan noise, and rotorcraft noise are given. The current challenges in each approach are summarized with a look toward the future developments. The review could be useful as a primer for new researchers or as a reference point to the state of the art for experienced professionals.}

The present study examines the effectiveness of an after-school version of the GDL program using a quasi-experimental design. Students enrolled in the GDL program were guided in the process of designing games aimed at solving problems. Compared to students in a control group who did not attend the program (n = 24), the children who attended the GDL program (n = 20) showed a significant increase in their problem-solving skills. The results provide empirical support for the hypothesis that participation in the GDL program leads to measurable cognitive changes in children's problem-solving skills.

However, identifying and quantifying all relevant parameters for such large-scale modelling remains a challenge. This study identifies key dynamic parameters used to project life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the Austrian building stock through 2050, while also analyzing their systemic interactions. Both operational GHG emissions from energy consumption in buildings and embodied GHG emissions from new constructions, renovations and demolitions are included. The Morris screening analysis and the Sobol global sensitivity analysis are applied to a building stock model that combines dynamic material flow analysis with prospective life cycle assessment. The two sensitivity analysis methods produce different rankings of the most influential parameters, underscoring the need to combine them for a more comprehensive analysis. In addition to energy-related parameters, the average living area per person also emerges as one of the most influential parameters, emphasizing the importance of incorporating efficient use of space into current policies. The study also evaluates the impact of the rate at which each parameter will evolve by 2050. For instance, if GHG reduction measures are implemented slowly, reducing personal heating consumption or changing construction material production will have a greater impact than changing heating systems. However, if heating system upgrades can be quickly implemented, they would have a greater effect than the other two measures. This suggests that prioritizing GHG reduction strategies should also take into account the speed at which these measures can be deployed. Additional research is necessary to enhance the application of systems thinking in building stock models.}

In this context, this paper proposes a fuzzy knowledge-based solution to build practical pupils, educators, and decision-makers recommender system to support the development of SR competencies in a data driver manner. Our system consists of:(1) inferring and computational module that calculates in a fuzzy manner the global appreciation to each SR-competencies.

The proposed solution has been tested on the last two levels of science education in four Tunisian elementary schools in different regions.

We propose the $-calculus as a more complete model for problem solving to provide a support to handle intractability and undecidability. It goes beyond the Turing Machine model. We define the semantics of the $-calculus using a novel optimization method (the kΩ-optimization), which approximates a nonexisting universal search algorithm and allows the simulation of many other search methods. In particular, the notion of total optimality has been utilized to provide an automatic way to deal with intractability of problem solving by optimizing together the quality of solutions and search costs. The sufficient conditions needed for completeness, optimality and total optimality of problem solving search are defined. A very flexible classification scheme of problem solving methods into easy, hard and solvable in the limit classes has been proposed. In particular, the third class deals with non-recursive solutions of undecidable problems. The approach is illustrated by solutions of some intractable and undecidable problems. We also briefly overview two possible implementations of the $-calculus.}

abstract = {Due to the widespread use of the internet, computer network systems may be exposed to different types of attacks. For this reason, the intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are often used to protect the network systems. Network traffic data (i.e., network packets) includes many features. However, most of them are irrelevant and can lead to a decrease in the runtime and/or the detection performance of the IDS. Although various data mining methods have been applied to improve the effectiveness of IDS, research regarding IDSs having high detection rates and better runtime performance (i.e., lower computational cost) is ongoing. On the other hand, the dimensionality reduction techniques help to eliminate unnecessary features and reduce the computation time of a classification algorithm. In the literature, the feature selection methods (i.e., filter and wrapper) have been widely used for the dimensionality reduction in IDSs. Although the wrapper feature selection techniques outperform the filters, they are time-consuming. Again, the ensemble classifiers can achieve higher detection rates for IDSs compared to the stand-alone classifiers, but they require more computation time to build the model. In order to improve the runtime performance and the detection rate of IDS, a swift wrapper feature selection and a speedy ensemble classifier are proposed in this study. For the dimensionality reduction, the swift wrapper feature selection (i.e., DBDE-QDA) is used, which consists of dichotomous binary differential evolution (DBDE) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA). For attack detection, the speedy ensemble classifier is used, which combines Holte's 1R, random tree, and reduced error pruning tree. In the experiments, the NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICDDoS2019 datasets are used. According to the experimental results, the proposed IDS reaches 95%–97.4%, 82.7%, and 99.5%–99.9% detection rates for the NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICDDoS2019 datasets. In this way, the proposed IDS competes with the state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection rate and false alarm rate. In addition, the proposed IDS has a lower computational cost than the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, DBDE-QDA reduces the dimension by 60.97%–82.92%, 73.46%, and 96.55%–98.85% for the NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICDoS2019 datasets.}

abstract = {In this new era, technological advancement toward the mission of a better tomorrow is reaching its limit because the exploration of the advanced possibilities of Artificial Intelligence is bounded with certain limitations. The application of analyzing various features of biosignal processing is key in the fields of medicine and healthcare. Biosignals such as Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electromyography (EMG), Electrooculography (EOG), Galvanic Skin Response(GSR), and Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is already giving deep insight into the human body toward the identification of diverse nature and disorders. In recent years, the research toward analyzing biosignal gained interest among many researchers. The primary limitation for the algorithms to analyze these signals for more possibilities of insight is its uncertainty. Even though the algorithms of Artificial Intelligence have the capabilities to unravel the mysteries, it is bounded with specific difficulties. The machine learning algorithms designed to manage uncertain data but lacks accuracy due to many factors. Also, complete supervision is needed in a training process that involves the extraction and selection of adequate features for the training. The deep learning method (a subset of machine learning) comes into the picture due to one of these facts. This, indeed, as a supervised learning method, needs a massive volume of data to train to reach the accuracy goal. The deep learning algorithm plays a significant role in today's Artificial Intelligence–based applications. However, this platform needs many requirements, such as (a) high computational power like graphical processing units (GPU); (b) similar to machine learning methods, a massive labeled dataset for supervised learning; (c) adequate parameter selection to avoid overfitting or underfitting. To overcome the problems highlighted, the strategy of adopting the behaviors of unsupervised learning (performed by the clustering algorithm) in the deep learning methodology is needed. To achieve the goal, two-phase operations were processed, such as (1) transformation of the data elements into a latent feature space (Z) is processed through a nonlinear mapping of deep learning networks; (2) clustering the latent feature space to k-clusters, and simultaneously, the clustering loss is fed to the deep learning network for the next iteration of operation concerning the objective function convergence analyzed by the Kullback–Leibler divergence. Various strategies of enhancing the nature of deep learning methods and clustering methodologies for an unsupervised learning process are addressed in this chapter.}

In this paper we reflect on two decades of experience with the application of language-based assessment to patients' mental state and cognitive function by addressing the questions of what we are measuring, how it should be measured and why we are measuring the phenomena. We address the questions by advocating for a principled framework for aligning computational models to the constructs being assessed and the tasks being used, as well as defining how those constructs relate to patient clinical states. We further examine the assumptions that go into the computational models and the effects that model design decisions may have on the accuracy, bias and generalizability of models for assessing clinical states. Finally, we describe how this principled approach can further the goal of transitioning language-based computational assessments to part of clinical practice while gaining the trust of critical stakeholders.}

Yet the approach based on the ontological primacy of stable and often hierarchical structures is still prevalent in theoretical and, most importantly, practical thinking about social systems. We propose a conceptual framework for thinking about a dynamically changing social system: the Living Cognitive Society. Importantly, we show how it follows from a much broader philosophical framework, guided by the theory of individuation, which emphasizes the importance of relationships and interactive processes in the evolution of a system. The framework addresses society as a living cognitive system – an ecology of interacting social subsystems – each of which is also a living cognitive system. We argue that this approach can help us to conceive sustainable social systems that will thrive in the circumstances of accelerating change. The Living Cognitive Society is explained in terms of its fluid structure, dynamics and the mechanisms at work. We then discuss the disruptive effects of Information and Communication Technologies on the mechanisms at work. We conclude by delineating a major topic for future research – distributed social governance – which focuses on processes of coordination rather than on stable structures within global society.}

Consequently, we propose the improved Laplacian centrality (ILC) to identify influential nodes based on the concept of self-consistent. Identifying results on 9 real networks prove that ILC is superior to LC and other 6 classical measures in terms of ranking accuracy, top-k nodes identification and discrimination capability. Moreover, the computational complexity of ILC has not significantly increased compared to LC, and remains the linear order of magnitude O(m). Additionally, ILC has excellent robustness and universality such that there is no need to adjust parameters according to different network structures.}

There are many subcategories, especially for Materialism Theories. Each explanation is self-described by its adherents, critique is minimal and only for clarification, and there is no attempt to adjudicate among theories. The implications of consciousness explanations or theories are assessed with respect to four questions: meaning/purpose/value (if any); AI consciousness; virtual immortality; and survival beyond death. A Landscape of Consciousness, I suggest, offers perspective.}

However, the underlying mechanisms linking mindwandering to negative mood and cognition are still unclear. We hypothesized that MW could either directly enhance negative thinking or indirectly heighten the accessibility of negative thoughts. In an undergraduate sample (n=79) we measured emotional thoughts during the Sustained Attention on Response Task (SART) which induces MW, and accessibility of negative cognitions by means of the Scrambled Sentences Task (SST) after the task. We also measured depressive symptoms and rumination. Results show that in individuals with elevated levels of depressive symptoms MW during SART predicts higher accessibility of negative thoughts after the task, rather than negative thinking during the task. These findings contribute to our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of MW and provide insight into the relationship between task-involvement and affect.}

Computational creativity or artificial creativity was established as a domain in the late 90’s, with different fields such as verbal, musical, or graphical creativity. With the latest technological advances and the appearance of Large Language Models (LLMs), creativity as a feature of machines gained more and more interest in the scientific community. The scope of this study is twofold: to design a comprehensive benchmark for verbal creativity assessment of LLMs and then to run the same creativity tests on different LLMs as well as on humans, for a direct comparison. We aimed to raise the replicability and extensibility of the creativity assessment of LLMs. Hence, we adapted different types of creativity tests and different criteria from psychology to fit the LLMs profile. We also employed computer-assisted evaluation methods, by using the Open Creativity Scoring with Artificial Intelligence (OCSAI), as we wanted to focus exclusively on automated approaches to assessing creativity. We quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed the data set of both human and machine-generated answers and interpreted the results. Finally, we provide both the original verbal creativity test that we have designed, and the curated data comprising all the collected answers, from the LLMs and from the humans that participated in this research.}

One of the major categories of SSL methods, graph-based semi-supervised learning (GBSSL) learns labels of unlabeled data on an adjacency graph, where neighborhood sparse graph is often used to reduce computational complexity. However, the neighborhood size is difficult to set. Instead of assigning a concrete value of neighborhood size, we propose a new label propagation algorithm called multi granularity based label propagation (MGLP) and developed from the view of granular computing. In MGLP, labels of unlabeled data are learned by two classic label propagation processes with diverse neighborhood size k, where granular computing delivers a guiding strategy to leverage multiple level neighborhood information granules, and three-way decision acts as an active learning strategy to select the unlabeled data for further annotating. Through the iterative procedures of label propagating, data annotating and data subset updating, the ultimate pseudo label accuracy of unlabeled data may be higher. Theoretically, the accuracy of pseudo labels is enhanced in some scenarios. Experimentally, the results of simulation studies on ten benchmark datasets, show that the proposed method MGLP can rise pseudo labels accuracy by 8.6% than LP (label propagation), 6.5% than LNP (linear neighborhood propagation), 6.4% than LPSN (label propagation through sparse neighborhood), 4.5% than Adaptive-NP (adaptive neighborhood propagation) and 4.6% than CRLP (consensus rate-based label propagation). It also provides a novel way to annotate data.}

The internet and the information revolution may finally offer the opportunity to use and develop inductive learning practices and information based social inquiry in ways Pragmatic philosophers envisioned a hundred years ago, while the recent rise of connectionist and cognitive architecture works provides a concrete context for such developments. This confluence of process represents the type of synergy that only history can offer. The information revolution – exemplified by both the rise of connectionism and the internet – is the apotheosis of the Pragmatic revolution – bringing together radical empiricism and democratization of information in community practice. We offer three important realizations in our understanding of how information is organized and thinking progresses made possible by burgeoning virtual communities on the internet – open source thinking, scale-free networks, and interrelationships in the development of blogs to illustrate our thesis.}

But there is a drawback: algebraic mathematics restricts economic modeling to what can be expressed only in quantitative nouns, and this forces theory to leave out matters to do with process, formation, adjustment, and creation—matters to do with nonequilibrium. For these we need a different means of understanding, one that allows verbs as well as nouns. Algorithmic expression is such a means. It allows verbs—processes—as well as nouns—objects and quantities. It allows fuller description in economics, and can include heterogeneity of agents, actions as well as objects, and realistic models of behavior in ill-defined situations. The world that algorithms reveal is action-based as well as object-based, organic, possibly ever-changing, and not fully knowable. But it is strangely and wonderfully alive.}

However, the potential interplay between EFs and SES remains underexplored. This study addressed this gap by comprehensively investigating the moderating role of SES in the relationship between EF subcomponents (i.e., interference inhibition, response inhibition, and working memory) and children’s concurrent and future mathematical abilities (i.e., arithmetic operations and logical–visuospatial skills). A total of 172 participants (Mage = 6.78 years; 107 boys) took part in the study at the beginning of first grade in elementary school (T1) and 20 months later (T2). We measured EFs, SES, and mathematical ability at T1 and mathematical ability at T2. Results from hierarchical linear regression models indicated that working memory was positively associated with T1 arithmetic operations and logical–visuospatial skills as well as with T2 arithmetic operations. Furthermore, family SES was positively associated with arithmetic operations at both T1 and T2. Notably, we found a significant interaction effect between interference inhibition and SES on T1 arithmetic operations and logical–visuospatial skills. Specifically, interference inhibition was positively related to T1 arithmetic operations and logical–visuospatial skills for children from low- and middle-SES families, but not for children from high-SES families. Our findings contribute to a nuanced understanding of how cognitive and environmental factors jointly influence mathematical development, underscoring the need for targeted interventions for children from different SES backgrounds to support their mathematical ability development.}

In this approach, culture is conceived of as a system and a process of symbolic mediation, where values, norms, and beliefs manifest in and through customs, rituals, and practices in directing and regulating both intrapersonal and interpersonal psychological functions. To capture the dynamic process in which cognitive development unfolds in cultural context, this approach examines the influence of culture on the developing cognitive skills between groups – group level analysis, between the child and socialization agents – dyadic level analysis, at the level of the child – individual level analysis, and within the child – situation level analysis. The temporal level analysis further situates cognitive development in historical time. By utilizing different analytical and methodological strategies, the multi-level analysis approach provides converging evidence for the development of cognitive skills in cultural context. Important challenges in this approach include the development of a “big picture” to guide the investigation, methodological training for research assistants, and difficulties in collecting, managing, and analyzing diverse datasets. I discuss the conceptual and methodological issues by using our work on the development of episodic thinking as an example.}

The measurement of resistance to miserly information processing has been assessed using several tasks, including ratio bias, belief bias syllogisms, cognitive reflection, and disjunctive thinking tasks. Several of these tasks have been studied in developmental samples, including in the longitudinal study described in this volume. There is evidence to suggest that resistance to miserly information processing is measurable in children and youth. While judgment and decision-making tasks vary in the degree to which override of miserly processing is required, individuals also vary in their ability to resist miserly processing tendencies. Individual differences in resistance to miserly information processing serve as an additional foundation to support rational thinking performance.}

Thinking differently, in silico methods could be used to provide a detailed assessment of target- and modality-related toxicological risks, coupled with modelling of exposure. In vitro NAMs such as microphysiological systems, microelectrode array and ion channel panels could then be employed to address hypothetical risks. Finally, the safety of first time in human trials could be assessed and assured using circulating nanobots that measure conventional clinical pathology parameters alongside new biomarkers such as circulating tissue DNA.

abstract = {The underground pipeline network (UPN) is an essential infrastructure and plays an irreplaceable role in national defense and urban activities. The complexity of structural environment and management makes its operation and maintenance difficult. To solve this problem, a distributed mixed reality (MR) and internet of things (IoT) system is developed through game thinking. Firstly, digital models are created based on design drawings and real-world environments, and then an MR system for the UPN is built by the game engine and the OpenXR platform. Secondly, an IoT cloud platform is built to connect with the MR system based on the API sets and cloud services; the data communication between sensors and MR devices is linked with the Socket method, and the data filtering model is constructed by the Kalman algorithm to realize the information exchange between the field workers and the backend managers. Finally, the National Center for Materials Service Safety at the University of Science and Technology Beijing (NCMS_USTB) is used as the experimental site to test this system, and its underground sewage and rainwater pipeline network are used to simulate the key problems in the operation and maintenance. The effect of the application shows that there is potential technical complementarity between the MR and IoT, and the distributed MR-IoT approach can be used as a new technical reference for the operation and maintenance of the UPN.}

But little is known about what they learn when programming a game. In this article, we present a strategy for coding student games, and summarize the results of an analysis of 108 games created by middle school girls using Stagecast Creator in an after school class. The findings show that students engaged in moderate levels of complex programming activity, created games with moderate levels of usability, and that the games were characterized by low levels of code organization and documentation. These results provide evidence that game construction involving both design and programming activities can support the learning of computer science concepts.}

abstract = {Four principal factors contribute to grain-boundary strengthening: (a) the grain boundaries act as barriers to plastic flow; (b) the grain boundaries act as dislocation sources; (c) elastic anisotropy causes additional stresses in grain-boundary surroundings; (d) multislip is activated in the grain-boundary regions, whereas grain interiors are initially dominated by single slip, if properly oriented. As a result, the regions adjoining grain boundaries harden at a rate much higher than grain interiors. A phenomenological constitutive equation predicting the effect of grain size on the yield stress of metals is discussed and extended to the nanocrystalline regime. At large grain sizes, it has the Hall–Petch form, and in the nanocrystalline domain the slope gradually decreases until it asymptotically approaches the flow stress of the grain boundaries. The material is envisaged as a composite, comprised of the grain interior, with flow stress σfG, and grain boundary work-hardened layer, with flow stress σfGB. The predictions of this model are compared with experimental measurements over the mono, micro, and nanocrystalline domains. Computational predictions are made of plastic flow as a function of grain size incorporating differences of dislocation accumulation rate in grain-boundary regions and grain interiors. The material is modeled as a monocrystalline core surrounded by a mantle (grain-boundary region) with a high work hardening rate response. This is the first computational plasticity calculation that accounts for grain size effects in a physically-based manner. A discussion of statistically stored and geometrically necessary dislocations in the framework of strain-gradient plasticity is introduced to describe these effects. Grain-boundary sliding in the nanocrystalline regime is predicted from calculations using the Raj–Ashby model and incorporated into the computations; it is shown to predispose the material to shear localization.}

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive ability in handling reasoning tasks. However, unlike humans who can instinctively adapt their problem-solving strategies to the complexity of task, most LLM-based methods adopt a one-size-fits-all approach. These methods employ consistent models, sample sizes, prompting methods and levels of problem decomposition, regardless of the problem complexity. The inflexibility of these methods can bring unnecessary computational overhead or sub-optimal performance. To address this limitation, we introduce an Adaptive-Solver (AS) framework that dynamically adapts solving strategies to suit various problems, enabling the flexible allocation of test-time computational resources. The framework functions with two primary modules. The initial evaluation module assesses the reliability of the current solution using answer consistency. If the solution is deemed unreliable, the subsequent adaptation module comes into play. Within this module, various types of adaptation strategies are employed collaboratively. Through such dynamic and multi-faceted adaptations, our framework can help reduce computational consumption and improve performance. Experimental results from complex reasoning benchmarks reveal that our method can significantly reduce API costs (up to 85%) while maintaining original performance. Alternatively, it achieves up to 4.5% higher accuracy compared to the baselines at the same cost. The datasets and code are available at https://github.com/john1226966735/Adaptive-Solver.}

The present study explores the role of various cognitive abilities in creativity among school children. Measures of creativity, visual-spatial working memory (VSWM), verbal short-term memory (STM), working memory (WM), and visual processing (VP) were administered to 331 students in Grades 4 and 5. Cluster analysis was used to group students' creativity levels. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted to test differences in cognitive abilities across the three clusters. Group differences between high and moderate level creativity students and low creativity students were found regarding VP abilities in the following tests: VSWM, visual discrimination (VD), and Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices (RCPM). Group differences between high creativity students and low creativity students were also found on verbal STM and WM. Additionally, structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis revealed that VP can significantly account for unique variances associated with creativity, while verbal STM and WM are not significantly related to creativity. These findings enlighten the cognitive processes underlying creativity in young children.}

Its major achievements include methodologies and tools to support process modeling, simulation and optimization (MSO). Mature, commercially available technologies have been penetrating all fields of chemical engineering in academia as well as in industrial practice. MSO technologies have become a commodity, they are not a distinguishing feature of the PSE field any more. Consequently, PSE has to reassess and to reposition its future research agenda. Emphasis should be put on model-based applications in all PSE domains including product and process design, control and operations. Furthermore, systems thinking and systems problem solving have to be prioritized rather than the mere application of computational problem solving methods. This essay reflects on the past, present and future of PSE from an academic and industrial point of view. It redefines PSE as an active and future-proof research field which can play an active role in providing enabling technologies for product and process innovations in the chemical industries and beyond.}

abstract = {Neurocognitive research is pertinent to developing mechanistic models of how humans generate creative thoughts. Such models usually overlook the role of the motor cortex in creative thinking. The framework of embodied or grounded cognition suggests that creative thoughts (e.g. using a shoe as a hammer, improvising a piano solo) are partially served by simulations of motor activity associated with tools and their use. The major hypothesis stemming from the embodied or grounded account is that, while the motor system is used to execute actions, simulations within this system also support higher-order cognition, creativity included. That is, the cognitive process of generating creative output, not just executing it, is deeply embedded in motor processes. Here, we highlight a collection of neuroimaging research that implicates the motor system in generating creative thoughts, including some evidence for its functionally necessary role in generating creative output. Specifically, the grounded or embodied framework suggests that generating creative output may, in part, rely on motor simulations of possible actions, and that these simulations may by partially implemented in the motor regions themselves. In such cases, action simulations (i.e. reactivating or re-using the motor system), do not result in overt action but instead are used to support higher-order cognitive goals like generating creative uses or improvising.}

On ‘area’ trials, test width was a random variable, ensuring that neither shape (aspect ratio), width nor height by themselves was a reliable signal. Weber fractions for width and height of both ellipses and rectangles were in the range 5–10%, but for area they were higher (10–20%) than predicted from the combination of noisy width and height decisions. With ellipses, observers were more likely to overestimate width or height when the other dimension differed from the standard in the same direction (e.g. both greater). We conclude that observers have no access to high-precision codes for 2-D area, and that they base their decisions on a variety of heuristics derived from 1-D codes. A second experiment measured acuity for changes in aspect ratio. For ellipses, accuracy for aspect ratio was higher than predicted by the combination of noisy width and height signals; for rectangles it was worse, suggesting that 2-D curvature is a potent cue to shape.}

Our results show that the LIWC coding cannot be relied upon – precision falls to as low as 49.6 % and recall as low as 41.7 % for some categories.

Students’ expression of visual fluency in the course of making sense of the eigenvalue problem Au=λu associated with a variety of matrices occurred in different, yet not necessarily hierarchical modes of visualizations that differed from matrix to matrix: (i) synthetic/analytic mode manifested in the process of detecting eigenvectors when the sought eigenvector and the matrix-applied product vector were aligned in the same/opposite directions; (ii) analytic arithmetic mode manifested in the case of singular matrices (in the determination of the zero eigenvalue) and invertible matrices with nonreal eigenvalues; (iii) analytic structural mode, though rarely occurred, manifested in making sense of the trajectory (circle, ellipse, line segment) of the matrix-applied product vector and relating trajectory behavior to matrix type. While the connection between the thinking modes (Sierpinska, 2000) and the concreteness–necessity–generalizability triad (Harel, 2000) was not sharp, math majors still frequently implemented the CNG principles, which proved facilitatory tools in the evolution of students’ thinking about the eigenvalue–eigenvector relationships.}

abstract = {Creativity is related to a higher flexible semantic memory structure, which could explain greater fluency of ideas. Extensive research has identified a positive connection between creativity and bi-/multilingualism mainly in contexts where two languages or more concur in daily communicative interactions. Yet, creativity has received scant attention in regard to L2 (second or foreign language) acquisition that mainly takes place in classroom situations. The scarce research points to a positive relationship between creativity and L2 fluency – understood as the number of words produced. We apply computational network science analysis and Forward Flow methods to examine lexical organization patterns of a low creativity (LC) and high creativity (HC) group of 12th grade Spanish English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners. The participants completed two fluency tasks, where they generated animal names in their L2, and also L1 – used here as a control measure. EFL proficiency was controlled. Our analyses revealed that the HC individuals were more fluent in L1 and L2, generated more remote responses, and exhibited a more flexible and efficiently structured semantic memory in both languages, with a greater effect of creativity in L2. Contrary to previous research, the L2 semantic memory network exhibited a less random organization. Differences in the L2 learning conditions are adduced as likely causes of this result.}

abstract = {Misophonia is a disorder in which specific common sounds such as another person breathing or chewing, or the ticking of a clock, cause an atypical negative emotional response. Affected individuals may experience anger, irritability, annoyance, disgust, and anxiety, as well as physiological autonomic responses, and may find everyday environments and contexts to be unbearable in which their ‘misophonic stimuli’ (often called ‘trigger sounds’) are present. Misophonia is gradually being recognized as a genuine problem that causes significant distress and has negative consequences for individuals and their families. It has only recently come under scientific scrutiny, as researchers and clinicians are establishing its prevalence, distinguishing it from other disorders of sensory sensitivity such as hyperacusis, establishing its neurobiological bases, and evaluating the effectiveness of potential treatments. While ideas abound as to the mechanisms involved in misophonia, few have coalesced into models. The aim of the present work is to summarize and extend recent thinking on the mechanistic basis of misophonia, with a focus on moving towards neurologically-informed cognitive models that can (a) account for extant findings, and (b) generate testable predictions. We hope this work will facilitate future refinements in our understanding of misophonia, and ultimately inform treatments.}

abstract = {Underground construction work is heavily affected by surrounding hydrogeology, adjacent pipelines, and existing subway lines, which can lead to a high degree of uncertainty and generate safety risk on site. In order to overcome rigid thinking of causal factors within a structured framework and incorporate features of different accidents, this study adopted grounded theory for the investigation on factors contributing to workplace accidents in subway construction. The deep reinforcement learning model of double deep Q-network (DDQN) was developed for predicting subway construction safety risk, which integrated the advantage of reinforcement learning in decision making with the advantage of deep learning in objection perception. The findings denoted that DDQN performed better than other machine learning models inclusive of random forest, extreme gradient boosting, k-nearest neighbor, and support vector machine. Contributing factors relevant to subway construction accidents were quantitatively analyzed using permutation importance of attributes. It was beneficial for determining how the 37 contributing factors had negative effects on subway construction safety risk. Safety measures for risk reduction and controlling could be optimized according to permutation importance of individual contributing factor, which paved a new way for the promotion of safety management performance at subway construction sites.}

abstract = {Examining who (and what) stands to gain and lose in the smart city, and what kind of urban life smart cities create, are questions of a philosophical and ethical import. Since the early 2010s scholars and journalists have critiqued the smart city paradigm and examined its various projects and experimental initiatives to surface its ethical dimensions and significance. The smart city's rhetorical swing from tech-centric to human-centric and from smart city to smart citizen is construed here as a further effort to create the image of a more ethical smart city. Consequently, the topic of ethics has also intersected with the smart city in particular ways, and predominantly through the lens of data governance and the protection of privacy rights. This chapter argues for an expanded approach to smart city ethics. It proposes a focus on urban technology design to bridge the gap between a micro-ethical focus on data ethics and macro-level political-ethical critique. Bringing philosophical thinking on technology together with a design-led approach to urban technology is argued to provide a further way to draw out a potentially different set of ethical concerns and to explore how urban life can be lived with technology.}

abstract = {A large number of computational models of information processing in the basal ganglia have been developed in recent years. Prominent in these are actor–critic models of basal ganglia functioning, which build on the strong resemblance between dopamine neuron activity and the temporal difference prediction error signal in the critic, and between dopamine-dependent long-term synaptic plasticity in the striatum and learning guided by a prediction error signal in the actor. We selectively review several actor–critic models of the basal ganglia with an emphasis on two important aspects: the way in which models of the critic reproduce the temporal dynamics of dopamine firing, and the extent to which models of the actor take into account known basal ganglia anatomy and physiology. To complement the efforts to relate basal ganglia mechanisms to reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce an alternative approach to modeling a critic network, which uses Evolutionary Computation techniques to ‘evolve’ an optimal RL mechanism, and relate the evolved mechanism to the basic model of the critic. We conclude our discussion of models of the critic by a critical discussion of the anatomical plausibility of implementations of a critic in basal ganglia circuitry, and conclude that such implementations build on assumptions that are inconsistent with the known anatomy of the basal ganglia. We return to the actor component of the actor–critic model, which is usually modeled at the striatal level with very little detail. We describe an alternative model of the basal ganglia which takes into account several important, and previously neglected, anatomical and physiological characteristics of basal ganglia–thalamocortical connectivity and suggests that the basal ganglia performs reinforcement-biased dimensionality reduction of cortical inputs. We further suggest that since such selective encoding may bias the representation at the level of the frontal cortex towards the selection of rewarded plans and actions, the reinforcement-driven dimensionality reduction framework may serve as a basis for basal ganglia actor models. We conclude with a short discussion of the dual role of the dopamine signal in RL and in behavioral switching.}

We propose designs where power and performance are considered critical constraints. We describe power-aware and low power techniques to reduce the power profiles of parallel applications and mitigate the impact on performance.}

This chapter reviews the latest researches and advances in the uses of the computational modeling and ab initio calculations on the study of the MAX phases and their properties. The fundamentals and approaches of the density functional theory in the ab initio quantum mechanical calculations and the importance of the theory in the study of the MAX phases are introduced. The studies of the electronic structures and properties, in particular, the energy band structures and total and/or partial density of states of the MAX phases, by using the means of the density function theory are illustrated and discussed. The stability and occurrence of the MAX phases predicted and confirmed by the density functional theory based energetic calculations are addressed. The ab initio calculated elastic and other physical properties of the MAX phases, and the effects of pressure, defects and impurities on the various structural and physical properties are also discussed.}

Here we use computational modelling to evaluate evidence from two psychophysical studies collectively thought to demonstrate the existence of three separate and independent motion processing channels. We show that the pattern of psychophysical results can largely be accounted for by a single mechanism. The results demonstrate that a low-level luminance based approach can potentially provide a wider account of human motion processing than generally thought possible.}
