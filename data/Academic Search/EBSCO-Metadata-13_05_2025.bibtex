Analyzing public discussions and opinions provides valuable insights that can inform future educational policies and reforms. In this paper, we collected questions and answers related to CT education on the Quora platform. Next, we applied a topic modeling approach to find out major topics in online discussions. Through analysis, we identified 6 topics in questions and 14 topics in answers. Our findings revealed that people showed great interests but also uncertainty about CT education learning outcomes. Many people asked for suggestions on CT learning tools and platforms, but they struggled to identify appropriate information to support their learning needs. Among their answers, while people held positive attitudes toward CT education, they were concerned about the difficulties their children faced in the learning process and the ",

Debugging code is a central skill for students, but is also a considerable challenge when learning to program. Learners at the K-12 level often lack confidence in programming debugging due to a lack of effective learning feedback and programming fundamentals (e.g., correct syntax usage). With the development of technology, large language models (LLMs) provide new opportunities for novice programming debugging training. We proposed a method for incorporating an LLM into programming debugging training, and to test its validity, 80 K-12 students were selected to participate in a quasi-experiment with two groups to test its effectiveness. The results showed that through dialogic interaction with the model, students were able to solve programming problems more effectively and improve their ability to solve problems in real-world ap",

Recent interest in incorporating early CT experiences in early childhood education (i.e., preschool) has increased. In fact, the early years mark an important time during which initial competencies are acquired, interest and motivation begins to form, and in which children may develop a sense of belonging in STEM fields. As a result, providing children with access to robotics and computer science experiences to support CT that are also developmentally appropriate and culturally relevant is key. This paper uses the "powerful ideas" of computer science, seven developmentally appropriate CT concepts that children can learn, as a framework and explores the experiences of two (composite) teachers who participated in and co-developed a culturally relevant robotics program and the processes they undertake to support children's CT development and learning.

Data was collected through two debrief focus groups -- one with BVI learners and one with the maker professionals who served as instructors. Analysis. All interviews were recorded and transcribed. The research team used a grounded theory approach to analyse the interview data. Results. Both learners and instructors highlighted the benefits of tactile and multi-sensory learning tools, though challenges emerged with the text-based coding platform. Learners self-reported increased confidence, autonomy, and interest in CT skills",

Despite the widespread use, students have primarily used smartphones for online gaming and social media, leading to a decline in the effectiveness for educational purposes. Therefore, this study aimed to explore how students in electronics engineering education responded to a novel technology, augmented reality (AR), when integrated into the fundamental learning process, in order to maximize the utility of smartphones.

This study aimed to explore young children's experiences in unplugged activities.

Results indicate that children had positive perceptions about the activities. In addition, young children's algorithmic thinking and debugging emerged most frequently.
