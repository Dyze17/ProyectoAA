This paper compares computational and critical modes of thinking, identifying concepts and terminology that support cross-disciplinary discourse, inform faculty and curriculum development efforts, and interconnect learning outcomes at the course, program and university level, thus helping programs better articulate contributions to institutional goals.

Unfortunately, standardized, valid, and reliable methods to assess CT skills in preschool children are lacking, compromising the reliability of the results reported in CT interventions.

The theoretical model underpinning the BCTt-SF was supported by dimensionality assessment, which suggested that preschool students can be distinguished in terms of four specific abilities (i.e., sequences, simple loops, nested loops, and conditionals) and that all of these abilities were related by a general factor.

Second, because of the complexity of computational modelling and the variety of potential computational tools available, I suggest attention to computational thinking, instrumental genesis, and dynamic technology scaffolding as we consider productive learning trajectories for teachers and students and offer a specific example for consideration.

 abstract  = "Since the publishing of Nolan and Temple Lang's "Computing in the Statistics Curriculum" in 2010, the American Statistical Association issued new recommendations in the revised GAISE college report. To reflect modern practice and technologies, they emphasize giving students experience with multivariable thinking. Students develop multivariable thinking when they analyze real data in the context of investigating research questions of interest, which typically involve complex relationships between many variables. Proficiency in a statistical programming language facilitates the development of multivariable thinking by giving students tools to investigate complex data on their own. However, learning a programming language in an introductory course is difficult for many students. In this article, we recommend a set of computational skills for introductory courses, demonstrate them using R tidyverse, and describe a classroom activity to develop computational skills and multivariable thinki",

 abstract  = "A number of efforts have focused on preparing teachers to integrate CT within secondary disciplinary subject areas; however, there is little research on how CT ideas could be embedded within elementary subjects. We designed a professional development activity for elementary teachers to embed CT within science and examined how their understanding of CT emerged over the course of PD. This paper reports results from qualitative analysis of teacher responses to vignettes and open-ended questions, which presented teaching scenarios related to CT. We found that the vignettes allow us to see shift in teachersâ€™ thinking about CT from broad and generalized ideas to more elaborate versions of those ideas. We discuss that while vignettes provided a good method to portray changes in teacher views about CT, we need additional mechanisms to monitor how teachers conceptualize and come to integrate computational thinking into elementary schools.",

A sample of 287 primary school students in grades four to six completed a corresponding survey. Confirmatory factor analysis validated the proposed components of the programming empowerment instrument. A structural equation model indicated that students with greater interest in programming perceived it as more meaningful, had greater impact, had greater creative self-efficacy, and had greater programming self-efficacy. Also, students with attitudes toward collaboration that were more positive than others had greater creative self-efficacy. Boys showed more interest in programming than girls did. Students in higher grade levels than others viewed programming as less meaningful and had lower programming self-efficacy. These results supp",

We examined culturally responsive teaching self-efficacy (CRTSE), culturally responsive teaching outcome expectancy (CRTOE) beliefs, and attitudes toward computational thinking (CT) as teachers participated in one of three treatment groups: robotics only, game design only, or blended robotics/game design. Descriptive data revealed that CRTSE gain scores were higher in the robotics only and blended contexts than in the game design only context. However, CRTOE beliefs were consistent across all treatment groups. In regard to CT attitudes, teachers’ gain scores were higher in the game design only and blended contexts than in the robotics only context. In addition, there were differences by treatment group related to STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) practices, while cultural artifacts were evident in each learning environment.

CT offers a powerful epistemic frame that, by foregrounding core dispositions and practices useful in computer science, helps students understand mathematical concepts as outward oriented. The article conceptualizes the characteristics of CT dispositions through a review of relevant literature and examples from a study that explored secondary mathematics teachers' engagement with CT.

However, research on assessing CT has lagged, with few assessments being implemented and validated. Moreover, there is a lack of systematic grouping of CT assessments. This scoping review examines 39 empirical studies published within the last five years, coded by the specific competencies outlined in existing CT frameworks, to identify and classify the key features of existing CT assessments. Results show that most studies target K-12 settings, focus on interventions that promote CT concepts and practices, adopt a quasi-experimental design, use selected-response items as the dominant testing form, and mainly assess algorithmic thinking, abstraction, problem decomposition, logical thinking, and data. Finally, few CT assessments have been validated in educational settings. Implications include identifying gaps in the CT assessment litera",

The current work deepens in the same direction as it aims to extend the nomological network of CT with non-cognitive factors, through the study of the correlations between CT, self-efficacy and the several dimensions from the ‘Big Five’ model of human personality: Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism.
